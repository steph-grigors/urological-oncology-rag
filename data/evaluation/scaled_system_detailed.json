    "topic": "prostate",
    "answer": "Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is defined as the progression of prostate cancer despite standard androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), characterized by serum testosterone levels below 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) (Zarour and Alumkal, 2010). The median survival for patients with CRPC is approximately 14 months, with a significant proportion developing metastasis within two years, leading to increased mortality (Kirby et al., 2011; Hirst et al., 2012).\n\nTreatment options for CRPC are limited and primarily palliative, focusing on extending survival rather than achieving a cure. Current strategies include:\n\n1. **Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT)**: Often used in combination with other treatments, ADT remains a cornerstone in managing prostate cancer, including CRPC (Doc 2).\n2. **Chemotherapy**: Combining ADT with chemotherapy has shown to improve survival, although it may come with significant side effects (Doc 2).\n3. **Immunotherapy**: Some studies indicate that combining immunotherapy with ADT can extend survival by approximately 8.5 months (Doc 2).\n4. **Novel agents**: Ongoing clinical trials are investigating new therapeutic approaches, including PARP inhibitors and other targeted therapies (Doc 1).\n\nOverall, while current treatments can extend life, they are not curative, and the search for more effective therapies continues (Doc 2).",

It is considered the gold standard for preventing disease relapse and progression. BCG is administered intravesically, typically starting approximately two weeks after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, with an induction phase consisting of six weekly instillations followed by maintenance therapy for 1 to 3 years to enhance efficacy and reduce recurrence rates [Doc 2].\n\nThe mechanism of action involves the activation of the immune system, particularly T lymphocytes, which target and kill tumor cells. Despite its effectiveness, BCG therapy is associated with a high rate of adverse effects, including systemic side effects in 30-40% of patients and potential life-threatening complications such as sepsis [Doc 1]. Additionally, there are challenges such as supply shortages and the emergence of treatment-resistant cases [Doc 2].",
