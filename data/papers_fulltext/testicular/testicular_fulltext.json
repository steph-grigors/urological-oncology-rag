    "title": "Vascular aging in long-term survivors of testicular cancer more than 20 years after treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy",
    "abstract": "Background Late effects of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in testicular cancer survivors (TCS) include cardiovascular morbidity, but little data is available beyond 20 years. The objective was to assess vascular damage in very long-term TCS. Methods TCS (treated with chemotherapy or orchiectomy only) and age-matched healthy controls were invited. Study assessment included vascular stiffness with ultrasound measurement of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV). Results We included 127 TCS consisting of a chemotherapy group (70 patients) and an orchiectomy group (57 patients) along with 70 controls. Median follow-up was 28 years (range: 20–42). The cf-PWV (m/s) was higher in TCS than in controls (geometrical mean 8.05 (SD 1.23) vs. 7.60 (SD 1.21),  p  = 0.04). The cf-PWV was higher in the chemotherapy group than in the orchiectomy group (geometrical mean 8.39 (SD 1.22) vs. 7.61 (SD 1.21),  p  < 0.01). In the chemotherapy group cf-PWV increased more rapidly as a function of age compared to controls (regression coefficient  b  7.59 × 10 −3  vs. 4.04 × 10 −3 ;  p  = 0.03). Conclusion Very long-term TCS treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy show increased vascular damage compatible with “accelerated vascular aging” and continue to be at risk for cardiovascular morbidity, thus supporting the need for intensive cardiovascular risk management.

        "content": "Although it accounts for only 1% of all cancers in men, testicular cancer (TC) is the most common solid malignancy affecting males between the ages of 15 and 35 years. 1  Depending on disease stage, TC is treated by either orchiectomy alone or by orchiectomy followed by radiotherapy (RT) or platinum-based chemotherapy (CT). Since the introduction of cisplatin in the late 1970s, 2  TC survival has increased, with 10-year survival rates reaching 90-95%. 3 , 4  However, successful treatment is often accompanied by adverse late treatment effects, resulting in increased morbidity from second cancers, 5  cardiovascular disease (CVD), 6 – 10  nephrotoxicity, 11 , 12  pulmonary toxicity 13  and Raynaud’s phenomenon. 14 , 15  Many of these late treatment effects of CT may be different manifestations of the same underlying vascular damage, possibly induced directly by cisplatin-based CT or indirectly by increased CVD risk factors after CT. 16 , 17  This increased morbidity coincides with increased long-term mortality: patients treated with CT for TC had a 1.6-fold (95% CI = 1.0–2.5) higher risk of dying from CVD compared to the general population 10 years after treatment. 18  An alarming clinical feature is the relatively young age at which TC survivors develop CVD, 8 , 10  which led to the hypothesis that TC patients treated with CT show a phenotype resembling accelerated aging. 9 , 19 , 20  However, the mechanisms underlying this cardiovascular morbidity have not been extensively studied. 21  In addition, most data on the incidence of late effects have been collected through questionnaires in large epidemiological studies in TC survivors up to 15 years post-treatment. Consequently, little information is available on the health status of TC patients surviving more than 20 years. We, therefore, assessed the presence of vascular damage in this group of very long-term TC survivors in comparison to age-matched controls. Our primary aim was to quantify long-term cardiovascular morbidity and gain more insight into factors related to the development of these late treatment effects. This insight is relevant to cancer survivorship care and could guide future interventional study protocols to reduce cardiovascular morbidity in long-term testicular cancer survivors."

        "content": "In this analysis we report on two groups of TC survivors—those treated with orchiectomy only and those treated with orchiectomy followed by CT—in comparison with age-matched controls (Fig.  1 ). For the first group, we randomly selected 70 TC survivors from the institutional database who had previously been treated with both surgery and CT at the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG). For the second group, 57 age-matched patients who had been treated with orchiectomy only were included. Inclusion criteria for both groups were the following: <40 years of age at diagnosis, <70 years of age at inclusion in the current study, and treatment for TC was ≥20 years ago. For the CT group, patients were treated with CT for either good or intermediate prognosis according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification (IGCCCG). For both groups, patients receiving RT or CT for any other indication were excluded. The age-matched male controls were recruited through advertisement using flyers distributed in the campus area of the UMCG, especially in the non-patient areas and in neighbouring supermarkets. Fig. 1 Consort diagram. The institutional database of testicular cancer patients was used to identify testicular cancer survivors (TCS) treated with chemotherapy (CT). Patients were randomly selected and screened for inclusion. Eligible CT patients were approached if they were still alive and met the inclusion criteria: <40 years of age at diagnosis, <70 years of age at inclusion in the current study, treatment for TC was ≥20 years ago and patients were treated with CT for either good or intermediate prognosis according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification (IGCCCG). This led to screening 301 CT patients with 138 not eligible. 91 of the eligible patients decided not to participate in the study. Next, the institutional database of testicular cancer patients was used to identify TCS treated with orchiectomy only. Patients were age-matched to the CT group and approached for inclusion if they were alive and met the inclusion criteria: <40 years of age at diagnosis, <70 years of age at inclusion in the current study, treatment for TC was ≥20 years ago and patients were not treated with CT for any indication. This led to screening 268 orchiectomy-only patients with 126 not eligible and 83 patients who decided not to participate in the study. Furthermore, 70 age-matched healthy controls were included.

This led to screening 268 orchiectomy-only patients with 126 not eligible and 83 patients who decided not to participate in the study. Furthermore, 70 age-matched healthy controls were included. Anthropometrics (weight, height, waist and hip circumference) and standardised blood pressure were measured. Fasting blood samples were used to establish presence of hypogonadism (defined as serum testosterone <10.9 nmol/L or treatment with testosterone supplementation), lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)), glucose and HbA1C levels and creatinine levels. Presence of metabolic syndrome was assessed according to the National Cholesterol Education Programme (NCEP) Adult Treatment Plan (ATP) III criteria. 22 Vascular function and structure measurements were performed by two specialised technicians at the vascular laboratory—the reproducibility was previously tested at our laboratory, showing an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.91 (95% CI 0.83–0.96) between the two vascular technicians. 23  Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV)—chosen for its validated, and added value in CVD risk assessment compared to conventional risk factors alone—was calculated by simultaneously measuring arm blood pressure (SphygmoCor). Measurements were performed in duplicate and single sided for each patient (a description in more detail is provided in  Supplementary Methods ). Only measurements with a variance of <10% were considered reliable. All measurements were performed according to the quality guidelines of the SphygmoCor. Presence of Raynaud’s phenomenon, as a potential sign of small vessel disease, was evaluated with standardised digital cooling tests (fingertip photoelectric plethysmography (PPG), cooling from room temperature to 6 °C). Symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon were scored with the Scale for Chemotherapy-Induced Neurotoxicity (SCIN). 24 Fasting blood samples were used to assess biochemical markers for vascular damage (von Willebrand factor (vWF)), coagulation markers (i.e. FVIII, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)) and C-reactive protein (CRP). To assess creatinine clearance and albuminuria, 24-h urine samples were used. cf-PWV was skewed and was log transformed to approximate a normal distribution. Differences in cf-PWV are reported as geometrical means. Multivariate regression analysis was performed on the logarithmic transformed cf-PWV according to a stepwise backwards method. Corresponding regression coefficients and p-values are reported. Plotting cf-PWV as a function of age was done by using the previously calculated regression coefficients, transformed back to a non-logarithmic value. Regression coefficients of age and cf-PWF were compared by including the interaction term of [age*treatment group] in the multiple regression model, and corresponding P-values for the difference in slopes are reported. Additional statistical methods are described in the supplementary Patients and Methods. All  P -values were two sided and the threshold of statistical significance was set at  p  < 0.05. The data were analysed by using SPSS 23.0 (IBM-SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA)."

Patient demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics at follow-up according to treatment group are reported in Table  1 . Additional patient characteristics including details on chemotherapeutic regimens used and medical history of cardiovascular disease are shown in Table  2 . There were no significant differences in age, follow-up (FU) duration, smoking behaviour, pack years, renal function, serum glucose and HbA1C between TC survivors and the controls. TC survivors were more likely to have hypertension compared to the controls (OR 2.2 [95% CI, 1.2–4.0]). The prevalence of hypertension was comparable for the CT group and the orchiectomy only group. TC survivors had higher BMI compared to the controls (median 26.5 kg/m 2  [range 20–42] vs. 25.6 kg/m 2  [range 20–38],  p  = 0.02). Use of lipid-lowering medication was more prevalent in TC survivors compared to controls (OR 3.0 [95% CI, 1.1–8.1],  p  = 0.03) and was more prevalent in the CT group than in the orchiectomy-only group (OR 3.2 [95% CI, 1.2–8.6],  p  = 0.02).

TC survivors had higher cf-PWV compared to controls (geometrical mean 8.07 m/s [95% CI: 7.82–8.37] vs. 7.58 m/s [95% CI: 7.24–7.94]  p  = 0.04). The CT group had higher cf-PWV compared to the orchiectomy-only group (geometrical mean 8.46 m/s [95% CI: 8.06–8.88] vs. 7.61 m/s [95% CI: 7.22–8.02],  p  = 0.004). There was no difference in cf-PWV between the orchiectomy-only group and controls (geometrical mean 7.61 m/s [95% CI; 7.22–8.02] vs. 7.58 m/s [95% CI; 7.24–7.94],  p  = 0.91). The cf-PWV was comparable for different chemotherapy regimens used in the CT group. In a multiple regression analysis on cf-PWV including all participants, age, presence of metabolic syndrome, having received CT and the amount of smoking pack years were independent factors (model R 0.67,  p  < 0.01, Table  3 ). Other factors included in the model, such as BMI and testosterone levels, did not significantly contribute to the model. cf-PWV as a function of age using the regression coefficients calculated in the multivariate model is depicted in Fig.  3  for participants in the CT group and control group. The linear regression line of cf-PWV and age had a steeper slope in the CT group compared to the control group (regression coefficient  b  7.59 × 10 −3 ; standard error (SE) 1.22 × 10 −3  vs. 4.04 × 10 −3 ; SE 1.23 × 10 −3 ,  p  = 0.03). Regression formulas and comparison of regression coefficients of the groups are shown in Supplementary Table  1 .

Compared to 11% in the control group, 29% of TC survivors reported clinically significant symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon ( p  = 0.004). Patients in the CT group reported symptoms more frequently than those in the orchiectomy-only group (41% vs. 16%,  p  = 0.002). In the CT group, 22% had a high cumulative symptom score compared to 4% in the surgery group ( p  = 0.003) and 6% in the control group ( p  = 0.006) (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The mean number of digits with normal perfusion at any point in time during PPG is depicted in Fig.  4 . Ischaemic time was similar in TC survivors (median 15.0 min.

        "content": "In this uniquely long-term follow-up study focussing on vascular aging in TC survivors, median follow-up duration was 28 years. Signs of vascular damage were present in several compartments, illustrated by increased vascular stiffness measured by cf-PWV, increased ischaemic- and recovery time during digital cooling tests and the presence of albuminuria. The CT group had increased cf-PWV compared to the orchiectomy-only group and healthy controls. In a multivariate regression model including classical vascular risk factors, such as age, lipid levels, presence of hypertension and smoking habits, CT was a significant independent predictor for increased cf-PWV. The slope of the curve for cf-PWV as a function of age was significantly steeper in the CT group than in the control group, also when other known predictors of cf-PWV were taken into account such as smoking and components of metabolic syndrome. The above findings on vascular stiffness support the notion of accelerated vascular aging after CT in TC survivors. 25  The clinical relevance of increased arterial stiffness has become increasingly apparent by its proven added value in CVD risk assessment compared to conventional risk factors alone (e.g. age, sex, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking status and diabetes) improving 10-year CVD risk prediction up to 13%. 26  Consequently, assessment of arterial stiffness is currently recommended in guidelines to improve CVD risk stratification. 25  A systematic review and meta-analysis of more than 15,000 subjects showed that an increase of cf-PWV by 1 m/s corresponded to an age-, sex- and conventional risk factor-adjusted risk increase of 14% for CVD after a mean follow-up of 7.7 years. 26 , 27  As shown in Fig.  3 , the assumption of accelerated vascular aging in our study led to a difference in cf-PWV between the CT group and healthy controls of 2.03 m/s at age 70. This difference would correspond with an increase in relative risk of 30.5% for cardiovascular events after a mean follow-up period of 7.7 years. This seems in some contrast with the finding of a normalised CVD mortality ratio five years after diagnosis in 15.000 TC patients registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. 28  However, evidently earlier after treatment and—as the authors suggest—their results might be attenuated by improved CVD management. Furthermore, they reported on cardiovascular mortality rather than on CVD prevalence. Clinical data from the Danish Testicular Cancer database, confirmed a normalised mortality ratio after one year, but found a 1.6-fold (95% CI = 1.0–2.5) higher risk of dying from CVD compared to the general population longer (10 years) after treatment. 18  Several hypotheses on the potential mechanisms behind this increased cardiovascular morbidity with an early and a late peak in prevalence have been suggested. For one, direct vascular damage of cisplatin-based chemotherapy could increase early cardiovascular events and the vascular age at time of treatment, only to become symptomatic after years of additional aging. 17 , 29  Secondly, cisplatin-based chemotherapy might cause an increased prevalence of known CVD risk factors, thus indirectly resulting in subclinical cardiovascular damage and CVD in TC survivors earlier than expected. 17  Both these mechanisms—potentially in combination responsible—might be further worsened by long-term circulating platinum, detectable up to 20 years after administration of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. 30  Therefore, high-risk populations such as TC survivors treated with platinum-based CT could benefit from more intensive CVD risk factor management in order to reduce long-term cardiovascular morbidity. Interventions such as exercise training have repeatedly shown efficacy in preventing and reversing age-related arterial stiffness in patients with vascular risk factors, 31 – 33  and its clinical benefit in the oncological setting is still being explored ( NCT01642680 ). Meanwhile, prospective data of studies aiming to reduce the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in TC survivors, another important determinant of cf-PWV and CVD, are awaited. As intervention, two randomised controlled trials are currently recruiting TC patients with low serum testosterone post treatment randomising between testosterone supplementation or placebo in order to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome ( NCT02991209  and  NCT03339635 ) which could concurrently reduce CVD risk. In line with the increased ischaemic and recovery time, the CT group in our study reported symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon more often compared to the orchiectomy-only group and controls (41%). Previously reported incidences range between 20% and 40%, which is comparable to our findings. 14 , 15 , 34  However, in our study cf-PWV was not correlated with symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon or with ischaemic and recovery time during PPG. Therefore, these vascular phenomena may not be the result of the same pathophysiologic mechanism. In contrast, we showed that increased prevalence of albuminuria in TC survivors correlated with cf-PWV and could, therefore, be a manifestation of a common systemic vascular pathology. This is supported by elevated vascular biomarkers that also correlated with cf-PWV. Although these vascular biomarkers were statistically not different between the CT group and the orchiectomy only group (Table  4 ), this can partly be explained by a limited statistical power—CT treated survivors showed a trend towards higher vascular biomarkers. On the other hand, it might be the case that orchiectomy only is capable of its own to induce endothelial activation through a change in metabolic balance. 35  Another study showed that independent risk factors for albuminuria overlapped with those for both CVD and cf-PWV (e.g. age, obesity and components of metabolic syndrome). 36  Therefore, interventions to address cf-PWV and risk factors for CVD may also reduce the prevalence of albuminuria in TC survivors, regardless of initial treatment modality. Regarding possible limitations of this study: due to the single-cohort design with patients who have survived after TC treatment for a long period of time, our results could be influenced by selection bias. We lack data from deceased patients, who might have died early from CT-related causes, both during treatment and earlier during follow-up. The high proportion (27% in CT group) of patients on lipid-lowering medication could also attenuate the differences in cf-PWV reported. Consequently, our results potentially underestimate the burden of vascular damage in TC survivors. The relatively low participation rate of 55% could also have biased our results. Also, 23% of the CT survivors were treated with the PVB regimen—some of which received maintenance cisplatin treatment—potentially partly limiting this study’s conclusion to currently treated TC patients. In conclusion, TC survivors treated with CT show features of accelerated vascular aging as shown by increased arterial stiffness. This coincides with other vascular damage parameters such as albuminuria. cf-PWV is an important determinant in the development of CVD. We therefore advocate more intensive CVD management in TC survivors, especially when treated with platinum-based combination CT. This should start early at initiation of treatment, should continue at least one year after completion of treatment and preferably continue beyond the ten-year follow-up duration as currently recommended. Determining cf-PWV in TC survivors could aid in identifying survivors at risk for future CVD development. Prospective data from interventions, such as prevention or treatment of metabolic syndrome, shortly after treatment or during follow-up will also help develop an optimal strategy to ameliorate the accelerated aging process observed in TC survivors."

        "content": "In 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID‐19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, followed by a global pandemic. The management of patients with cancer and COVID‐19 infections requires more attention due to the complications of COVID‐19 while commencing cancer treatment. While there are reports that one of the mortality risks for patients with cancer is COVID‐19 infection, the combination with cancer treatment might be controversial given the impact on overall survival due to delays in cancer treatment. 1 ,  2  Testicular tumors are common malignancies in young males and are one of the most curable malignancies through appropriate multidisciplinary treatment. 3  This means that managing COVID‐19 infections in patients with testicular tumors is even more important, as treatment delays could affect the disease's cure rate. We report a case of advanced testicular tumor cured by early and appropriate resumption of chemotherapy after being affected by COVID‐19 during induction chemotherapy. In the clinical setting, decision‐making for planning treatment after COVID‐19 during intervention for malignancies is crucial. Thus, we also described the current recommended management map and guidance for chemotherapy plans in this COVID‐19 era."

        "content": "The patient was a healthy 36‐year‐old male. He smoked 20 cigarettes per day for 15 years, was married, and had one child. He had received 3 doses of coronavirus vaccine. In November 2022, he visited his local doctor with the chief complaint of left cervical swelling that he had been aware of for several days. He had a painless enlarged right scrotum, and CT showed multiple lung tumors and enlarged lymph nodes, which led to the suspicion of advanced testicular cancer (Fig.  1 ). After a right high orchiectomy, the histopathological diagnosis was embryonal carcinoma and seminoma without teratoma. The stage diagnosis was pT2N2M1a, stage IIIB, LDH368U/I, hCG2051mIU/mL, AFP5.3 ng/mL, with an intermediate risk on the IGCCC. On postoperative day 3, the patient started a chemotherapy regimen of BEP composed of cisplatin 20 mg/m 2  on days 1–5, etoposide 100 mg/m 2  on days 1–5, and bleomycin 30 mg/body on days 1, 8, and 15 at 3‐week intervals. On day 14 of the first cycle, fever with a body temperature of 38.3°C and cough were observed. Blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 1740/mm 3 , of which 49.4% were neutrophils and 41.4% were lymphocytes. Chest radiography and CT showed no evidence of pneumonia, and the lung metastases were smaller than before the BEP. The SARS‐CoV‐2 antigen test was positive, and the patient was diagnosed with mild COVID‐19. On the same day, Remdesivir (200 mg loading dose day 14, 100 mg once daily for days 15, 16) and Cefepime (4 g for days 14–19) were initiated because febrile neutropenia due to bacterial infection could not be ruled out. The COVID‐19 symptoms resolved the next day, and the patient's respiratory status remained stable. Bleomycin was discontinued on day 15. The resumption of anticancer chemotherapy was planned after consultation with multiple medical departments, and the second cycle of chemotherapy could be started with a 1‐day delay (on day 10 after the COVID‐19 diagnosis). After the second cycle, the patient progressed smoothly without delay, and the serum hCG level was negative on day 1 of the fourth cycle (Fig.  2 ). Evaluation after the fourth cycle showed a CR, and no additional chemotherapy or RPLND was necessary. The patient maintained remission of the testicular tumor (Fig.  3 ). Before BEP, radiography and CT imaging findings. (a) Chest radiography: multiple nodules in both lungs. (b) Multiple lung metastases. (c) Hilar lymph and paravalvular lymph node metastases. (d) Left pelvic lymph node metastases. (a) Chest radiography at the time of COVID‐19 diagnosis. (b) Serum hCG levels across the patient's treatment course after anticancer chemotherapy (BEP). CT imaging showed CR at cycle 4 and subsequent evaluations."

        "content": "To the best of our knowledge, there have been only a few case reports of the resumption of anticancer chemotherapy in patients after COVID‐19 infection 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7  (Table  1 ). In these reports, the timing of chemotherapy resumption varied, which should be considered on a case‐by‐case basis, considering various factors such as the type and progression of cancer and the severity of COVID‐19 infection. As noted earlier, cancer patients are at risk of severe COVID‐19 infection. 1 ,  2  Regarding anticancer chemotherapy, a meta‐analysis showed an increased risk of COVID‐19 death along with anticancer chemotherapy during the COVID‐19 infection period and 4 weeks prior to infection. 8  On the other hand, in a prospective cohort study, anticancer chemotherapy in the preceding 4 weeks had no significant effect on COVID‐19‐induced mortality. 9  Patients resuming anticancer chemotherapy may have an increased risk of COVID‐19 mortality, and caution should be exercised regarding COVID‐19 severity. The NCCN guidelines state that the duration of delay in cancer‐directed therapy is determined on a patient‐by‐patient basis, and if cancer‐directed therapy is urgently required due to uncontrolled cancer, it should be administered at the discretion of the oncologist. It also recommends that patients with mild to moderate COVID‐19 or asymptomatic positive SARS‐CoV‐2 with pulmonary involvement delay therapy for at least 10 days until improvement of symptoms and at least 24 h have passed since resolution of fever without the use of antipyretics. 10  To ensure cure in induction chemotherapy for advanced testicular tumors, deferral should be considered only if the patient is febrile on the scheduled start date or if blood tests show neutrophils <500/mm 3  and platelets <100 000/mm 3 , and deferral should be limited to 3 days or less. 11  In the present case, the start of the second cycle of BEP was limited to a delay of 1 day. In addition, the prognostic impact of skipping bleomycin on day 15 was judged to be low, as 3 cycles of BEP or 4 cycles of EP could be considered for patients with only on LDH 1.5–3 times the upper limit of normal in the IGCCC classification of intermediate risk. 12  From the above, we have experienced advanced testicular tumor that were able to achieve remission by only requiring minimal postponement of anticancer chemotherapy. As the number of cases in which anticancer chemotherapy is resumed after the COVID‐19 infection increases, the appropriate timing of resumption for each patient needs to be further investigated.

    "title": "High-dose chemotherapy as initial salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory testicular cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Background The role of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in the management of patients with relapsed/refractory germ-cell tumors has not been established in prospective studies. Our aim was to estimate the benefits and harm of this treatment in men with relapsed/refractory germ-cell tumors. Methods Electronic databases, conference proceedings, and trial registers until April 30, 2023, were searched. Randomized and non-randomized prospective controlled trials were included. Risk of bias assessments were performed using either RoB2 or ROBINS-I tools. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Time-to-event data were analyzed using the hazard ratio. The primary outcome was overall survival, and a meta-analysis was not conducted to assess it because non-randomized trials were judged to have a critical risk of bias. Categorical data were analyzed using a risk ratio. All results are presented with the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Results Four out of 3,824 records met the inclusion criteria, and three out of four were used to assess primary and secondary outcomes. Based on the IT94 study (N = 263 participants), single high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation may have little to no effect on overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95%CI 0.68 to 1.42; p = 0.916]. Non-randomized trials (N = 43 participants) showed contrasting results, which may be explained by the number of cycles of high-dose chemotherapy administered in each study. Regarding secondary outcomes, information was only provided for event-free survival, response rate, and acute toxicities. Conclusions Based on prospective data, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the proposal that high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation improves survival in men with relapsed/refractory germ-cell tumors. If this treatment is considered essential, the choice should be made by experienced clinicians at high-volume cancer centers.",

        "content": "The role of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) in the management of patients with relapsed or refractory germ-cell tumors (GCTs) has not been established in prospective studies. This intervention is expensive and may be associated with severe hematological and non-hematological toxicities, as well as death, while the impact of HDCT on quality of life (QoL) is largely unknown. Testicular GCT is a highly curable malignancy. In fact, roughly 90% of all testicular GCTs may be cured with medical treatment ( 1 ,  2 ). The majority of stage I testicular GCT patients are cured after radical orchiectomy. Stage II and III (metastatic) GCT patients undergo further treatments after surgery, including platinum-based chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Experience matters in GCT management. Analyses from the Swedish Norwegian Testicular Cancer Project and Scotland showed that patients with metastatic GCTs had better survival rates when they were treated at high-volume centers compared with those treated at low-volume hospitals ( 3 ). According to the The International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) Update Consortium, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for metastatic seminoma and non-seminoma significantly improved between 1990 and 2013 ( 1 ,  2 ). Despite these improvements, the 3-year overall survival of metastatic patients with relapsed or refractory disease after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy ranges from 6.1% to 77% ( 4 ). Regrettably, it is a matter of debate which is the best course of action across prognostic categories. The most relevant clinical practice guidelines in the management of germ-cell malignancies do not show a clear recommendation regarding the treatment of relapsed/refractory GCTs after first-line chemotherapy ( 5 ,  6 ). Guidelines and experts do provide a clear statement in two rare clinical scenarios: “growing teratoma” syndrome during or after platinum-based chemotherapy and resectable late relapsed GCTs, where salvage surgery would be the best treatment option ( 7 ,  8 ). In situations where chemotherapy is the cornerstone salvage therapy, it is still controversial if HDCT has a superior effect to conventional-dose chemotherapy (CDCT). In fact, several studies with contradictory results have been published on this topic, including phase I, II, and III clinical trials and retrospective studies as well as systematic reviews. In theory, increasing the dose of chemotherapy may amplify the treatment efficacy. High doses of chemotherapy may overcome the resistance of germ-cell tumor cells to conventional-dose regimens and improve survival. However, HDCT produces dose-limiting toxicities, making the bone marrow the most affected tissue that can be salvaged using stem cell transplant ( 9 ). The ability to safely deliver HDCT followed by AHCT is strongly associated with the medical team’s experience. Actually, it is well known that death rates due to toxicity are largely related to expertise ( 10 ,  11 ). Patients receiving HDCT require several supportive treatments and teamwork. Supportive care needed during treatment includes AHCT, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, transfusion of blood products, and intensive care unit support. Many unknowns exist regarding HDCT regimens, including the number of cycles, drugs, and the need for induction chemotherapy. This reflects what happens in daily clinical practice worldwide ( 12 ). Two phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have tested the efficacy of HDCT in previously treated GCT patients ( 13 ,  14 ). In addition, a current international phase III RCT is assessing the efficacy of Paclitaxel, Ifosfamide and Cisplatin (TIP) given at first relapse compared with Paclitaxel and Ifosfamide followed by Carboplatin and Etoposide (TI-CE) followed by AHCT ( 15 ). The IT94 trial used four cycles of Etoposide, Ifosfamide and Cisplatin (VIP)/Vinblastin, Ifosfamide and Cisplatin (VeIP) compared with three cycles of VIP/VeIP followed by one cycle of HDCT with AHCT. The second phase III trial compared one cycle of VIP followed by three cycles of high-dose chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide (arm A) versus three cycles of VIP and one cycle of HDCT while adding cyclophosphamide to carboplatin and etoposide (arm B). This study was terminated prematurely due to excess deaths in arm B. None of these studies produced meaningful results in terms of OS. The most meaningful data regarding HDCT come from retrospective studies. A study conducted at Indiana University treated 364 patients with either one or two courses of carboplatin and etoposide followed by AHCT between 2004 and 2014. The 2-year PFS was 60%, and the 2-year OS was 66% at a median follow-up of 3.3 years ( 16 ). Furthermore, Feldman et al. ( 17 ) reported a full dataset of 107 patients treated with the TI-CE regimen. This study showed a 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and OS of 47% and 52% (median follow-up, 61 months), respectively. Finally, systematic reviews (SRs) already published have based their conclusions mainly on survival endpoints (e.g., OS), forgetting other patient-important outcomes, including adverse events and QoL. Furthermore, those reviews have some methodological limitations, namely, no available protocol, no adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, no attempt to perform risk of bias assessment in included studies, and did not assess the certainty of the evidence ( 18 ,  19 ). This SR and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of HDCT followed by AHCT versus CDCT in improving OS, event-free survival (EFS), response rate, and PFS, determine the treatments’ impact on QoL and describe the treatment-related toxicities in men with relapsed or refractory GCTs."

Does high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation as initial salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory germ-cell tumors improve outcomes compared with conventional-dose chemotherapy? Primary outcome : overall survival. Secondary outcomes : quality of life, event-free survival, response rate, progression-free survival, and acute and chronic toxicities. Randomized and non-randomized prospective controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of HDCT followed by AHCT with CDCT for people with relapsed/refractory GCTs were included. Participants were men (≥15 years old at the date of diagnosis) with a diagnosis of GCTs, confirmed by either pathology or elevated tumor markers plus suggestive imaging, and patients with unequivocal evidence of relapse or progression after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for metastatic GCTs. Patients with extragonadal GCTs [retroperitoneum, mediastinum, or central nervous system (CNS)] were included if they met the aforementioned criteria. We used the intervention HDCT followed by AHCT (i.e., experimental arm) and CDCT (i.e., control arm). There are various HDCT and CDCT regimens; however, most of them share at least two chemotherapy drugs. Most HDCT regimens incorporate etoposide and carboplatin as cornerstone drugs. In contrast, the majority of CDCT regimens also include two keystone chemotherapies: ifosfamide and cisplatin. Hence, we considered all of them as one experimental arm (HDCT) and one control arm (CDCT). We also decided to include in the experimental arm the HDCT regimens that incorporated induction chemotherapy as well as HDCT regimens given in either a single or sequential way. MEDLINE PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL electronic databases were searched from inception to April 30, 2023 (see searching strategy in  Appendix 1–3  in the  Supplementary Material ). Language restrictions were not imposed. Reference lists of selected review articles were searched ( 9 ,  19 ,  22 ). Conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the International Society for Paediatric Oncology, the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, and the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation were also searched from inception to April 30, 2023. ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were scanned for ongoing trials (from inception to April 30, 2023). We uploaded all titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching into Covidence and removed any duplicates. One reviewer (JB) examined the remaining references and excluded any studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Then, we collected the full text of the studies that met the inclusion criteria based on the title, abstract, or both for detailed inspection. Two reviewers (JB and PD) independently assessed the eligibility of the retrieved papers and resolved any discrepancies through discussion. A PRISMA flow diagram was produced ( Figure 1 ). PRISMA flow diagram. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Two authors (JB and PD) independently extracted data using a customized template. Discrepancies were resolved between reviewers by discussion. Data on the characteristics of the study, participants, interventions, methods, outcomes, and details of funding sources for the included studies were extracted. Hazard ratio (HR) calculations spreadsheet was used to facilitate the estimation of HRs from included studies ( 23 ). We extracted data to enable intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses. Two authors (JB and PD) independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using either RoB2 ( 24 ) or ROBINS-I ( 25 ) tools according to the study design. Discrepancies were resolved between reviewers by discussion. The risk of bias was separately assessed for each outcome. Time-to-event data were analyzed using HR, and categorical data were analyzed using Response rate (RR). All results are presented with the corresponding 95% confidence interval. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The outcomes of the included studies did not have homogeneous definitions. Therefore, we decided to accept the definitions provided by the authors of the original studies. ITT analysis was applied to all outcomes when reporting results. A per-protocol analysis was utilized to assess adverse events (AEs). We would attempt to contact the study authors of the included studies. Meta-analysis for OS was not conducted because only one study had reliable data for analysis. The generic inverse–variance method was used to calculate time-to-event outcomes, considering that we could obtain log HR and standard errors from included studies. For categorical data, we decided to conduct meta-analyses using the Mantel–Haenszel method since it is more robust for sparse data ( 26 ). We employed STATA 17.0 to perform statistical analysis (see STATA commands in the  Supplementary Material ). Variability would have been investigated and handled following the Ann Arbor Heterogeneity Consensus Group recommendations ( 27 ,  28 ) if we had been capable of conducting a meta-analysis of OS (see the protocol in the  Supplementary Material  for further details). - Prespecified clinical covariates. We planned to investigate five variables with strong rationale: histological subtype, baseline risk as per International Prognostic Factors Study Group (IPFSG) prognostic score, type of CDCT regimen, type of HDCT regimen, and number of cycles of HDCT. Regrettably, we were not able to conduct subgroup analysis and meta-regression as we stated in the protocol. - Role of statistical heterogeneity . A non-significant Cochran’s Q test (p-value ≥ 0.1) or a small I 2  (<25%) would not have avoided the need to investigate clinical and methodological heterogeneity if we had been able to perform a meta-analysis of OS. We did conduct meta-analyses to explore some secondary outcomes further. However, due to the exploratory nature of secondary outcomes, clinical and methodological heterogeneities were not investigated. - Plotting and visual aids . We used a graphical presentation of the data included from studies (e.g., forest plots). A funnel plot was not used due to few available studies. We followed the next strategies for dealing with each source of multiplicity as we explained in detail in the protocol: - Multiple outcomes . We classified the outcomes into primary and secondary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were not part of the main conclusion of the review. - Multiple groups.  There are several HDCT and CDCT regimens; however, most of them share at least two chemotherapy drugs. Thus, we considered all of them as one intervention group and one control group. - Multiple time points . We combined information at different time points by assuming that the HR (as a summary estimate effect) is constant over time ( 29 ). - Multiple effect measures . OS and EFS can be measured using different metrics (e.g., median, 5-year rate, or HR). Since sufficient data were available, we calculated the HR for each time-to-event outcome. - Subgroup analyses.  Subgroup analyses were not conducted. - Multiple sources.  We maximized the information yield by collating all available data (duplicate publications, companion documents, or multiple reports of a primary trial). We used the most complete dataset aggregated across all known publications. We prepared a summary of the findings table using GRADEpro ( 30 ). For each outcome, a reviewer (JB) assessed the certainty of the evidence using the five GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) considerations ( 31 )."

In contrast, the majority of CDCT regimens also include two keystone chemotherapies: ifosfamide and cisplatin. Hence, we considered all of them as one experimental arm (HDCT) and one control arm (CDCT). We also decided to include in the experimental arm the HDCT regimens that incorporated induction chemotherapy as well as HDCT regimens given in either a single or sequential way."

ITT, intention-to-treat. See  Table 2 . Summary of findings. Explanations: OS: As per RoB2, the IT94 trial was judged to be at high risk of bias due to deviations from the intended intervention that arose due to experimental context. EFS: According to RoB2, the IT94 trial was judged to be at high risk of bias due to deviations from the intended intervention that arose due to experimental context, bias due to missing data, and detection bias. Response rate outcomes: According to RoB2, the IT94 trial was judged to be at high risk of bias due to deviations from the intended intervention and detection bias. 95%CI crosses the line of no effect. Hematological acute toxicity: high risk of detection bias. Gastrointestinal acute toxicity: high risk of performance (especially nausea and diarrhea) and detection bias. Wide 95%CI due to few events. Of 280 patients, 263 were evaluated for OS, considering data from the IT94 trial. After a median follow-up of 45 months, single HDCT followed by AHCT may have little to no effect on OS of men with relapsed GCTs (HR 0.98, 95%CI 0.68 to 1.42; p = 0.916; very low-certainty evidence). Mardiak’s (HR 0.25, 95%CI 0.07 to 0.86) and Faure-Conter’s (HR 0.61, 95%CI 0.20 to 1.82) studies showed contrasting and imprecise results, which may be explained by the number of cycles of high-dose chemotherapy administered in each study, patient’s characteristics, and the small sample size ( Figure 5  and  Table 3 ). Overall survival based on data provided by non-randomized controlled trials a . HDCT, high-dose chemotherapy; CDCT, conventional-dose chemotherapy; HR, hazard ratio; OS, overall survival. Hazard ratio calculations spreadsheet was used to facilitate the estimation of lnHRs and selnHRs from included studies  11 . Mardiak's study provided p-values for 1-year (p = 0.03) and 2-year OS (p = 0.6). We were only able to extract data (n/N) for 1-year assessment. p-Value was supplied for abstract publication of Faure-Conter's study. 194 . HDCT vs. CDCT: overall survival. HDCT, high-dose chemotherapy; CDCT, conventional-dose chemotherapy. The lack of granularity of time-to-event data reported by Mardiak’s and Faure-Conter’s studies and their critical risk of bias impeded us from conducting a meta-analysis of OS. The included studies did not provide data on QoL, PFS, and chronic toxicities. Considering only data supplied by the IT94 study, 263 out of 280 patients were evaluable for EFS. After a median follow-up of 45 months, single HDCT followed by AHCT may improve the EFS of men with relapsed GCTs (HR 0.80, 95%CI 0.59 to 1.10; p = 0.169; low-certainty evidence). Mardiak’s study did not report data on EFS. On the contrary, Faure-Conter’s trial did display EFS information. However, the lack of detail on time-to-event data hindered us from obtaining EFS for experimental and control arms. Of 280 patients from the IT94 trial, 247 were evaluated for response rate ( Table 4 ). Single HDCT followed by AHCT may result in little to no difference in the overall response rate (ORR) of men with relapsed GCTs (RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.84 to 1.26; p = 0.775; low-certainty evidence). Additionally, single HDCT with AHCT may not reduce failure of men with relapsed GCTs (RR 0.96, 95%CI 0.71 to 1.30; p = 0.775; low-certainty evidence). For further details about other response rate outcomes, see  Table 2 . Response rate outcomes only considering data from Pico 2005 ( 13 ). HDCT, high-dose chemotherapy; CDCT, conventional-dose chemotherapy; ORR, overall response rate; CR, complete response; PR, partial response. Mardiak’s and Faure-Conter’s studies supplied data to explore response rate outcomes further. Considering the limitations of data reported from those trials, we found no evidence that HDCT followed by AHCT improves response rate outcomes, including complete response (CR), ORR, and failure ( Table 5 ). Response rate considering data from Mardiak (2000) ( 32 ) and Faure-Conter (2014) ( 33 ). HDCT, high-dose chemotherapy; CDCT, conventional-dose chemotherapy; ORR, overall response rate; CR, complete response. See meta-analyses of complete response, overall response rate, and failure considering all included studies ( Figures 6 – 8 ). Meta-analysis of pooled estimates of complete response. Meta-analysis of pooled estimates of overall response rate. Meta-analysis of pooled estimates of failure. The included studies did not comprehensibly report acute AEs. The IT94 trial only reported some severe and life-threatening (G3≥) acute hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities. Mardiak’s study described acute hematological AEs and mentioned that non-hematological toxicities were rare during the study (e.g., two patients developed ischemic heart disease, and one patient had thrombophlebitis). Regarding Faure-Conter’s trial, the authors did not characterize acute toxicities whatsoever. Acute toxicities were evaluated as per ITT and protocol analyses (see  Supplementary Tables S4  and  S5  in the  Supplementary Material ). Of 280 patients from the IT94 study, 274 were evaluable for acute hematological toxicities. Single HDCT followed by AHCT probably results in little to no difference in neutropenia ≥ G3 of men with relapsed GCTs (RR 1.06, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.14; p = 0.134; moderate-certainty evidence). However, single HDCT with AHCT likely increases febrile neutropenia ≥ G3 (RR 1.57, 95%CI 1.30 to 1.91; p < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) as well as thrombocytopenia ≥ G3 (RR 1.54, 95%CI 1.30 to 1.82; p < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) of men with relapsed GCTs. Mardiak’s study found no evidence that HDCT, followed by AHCT, increases acute hematological toxicities of patients with GCTs (see  Supplementary Table S6  in the  Supplementary Material ). This is probably explained by the fact that the control arm did not receive the standard dose of VIP but 1.6 VIP (i.e., etoposide 600 mg/m 2 , ifosfamide 8,000 mg/m 2 , and cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 ). See Meta-Analysis of Febrile Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia considering all included studies ( Figures 9 ,  10 ). Meta-analysis of pooled estimates of febrile neutropenia ≥ G3. Meta-analysis of pooled estimates of thrombocytopenia ≥ G3. Of 280 patients from the IT94 trial, 274 were evaluable for acute gastrointestinal toxicities. Single HDCT followed by AHCT may result in a large increase in nausea/vomiting ≥ G3 (RR 3.30, 95%CI 2.03 to 5.38; p < 0.001; low-certainty evidence), diarrhea ≥ G3 (RR 9.36, 95%CI 2.22 to 39.42; p = 0.002; low-certainty evidence), and mucositis ≥ G3 (RR 16.43, 95%CI 5.25 to 51.39; p < 0.001; low-certainty evidence) of men with relapsed GCTs. The IT94 trial reported 9/138 deaths due to toxicities in the experimental arm and 4/136 deaths in the control arm. The causes of death due to toxicity can be found in  Supplementary Table S7  in the  Supplementary Material . Based on data from Pico’s trial, we concluded that single HDCT followed by AHCT may increase death due to toxicity of men with relapsed GCTs (RR 2.22, 95%CI 0.70 to 7.03; p = 0.176; low-certainty evidence). Mardiak’s and Faure-Conter’s studies reported one death each. In the first study, the patient died due to toxicity (i.e., septic shock) during the first cycle of 1.6 VIP. On the contrary, one patient died of renal and myocardial acute failure after receiving CarboPEC in Faure-Conter’s trial."

Mardiak’s study did not report data on EFS. On the contrary, Faure-Conter’s trial did display EFS information. However, the lack of detail on time-to-event data hindered us from obtaining EFS for experimental and control arms. Of 280 patients from the IT94 trial, 247 were evaluated for response rate ( Table 4 ). Single HDCT followed by AHCT may result in little to no difference in the overall response rate (ORR) of men with relapsed GCTs (RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.84 to 1.26; p = 0.775; low-certainty evidence).

See meta-analyses of complete response, overall response rate, and failure considering all included studies ( Figures 6 – 8 ). Meta-analysis of pooled estimates of complete response. Meta-analysis of pooled estimates of overall response rate. Meta-analysis of pooled estimates of failure. The included studies did not comprehensibly report acute AEs. The IT94 trial only reported some severe and life-threatening (G3≥) acute hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities. Mardiak’s study described acute hematological AEs and mentioned that non-hematological toxicities were rare during the study (e.g., two patients developed ischemic heart disease, and one patient had thrombophlebitis). Regarding Faure-Conter’s trial, the authors did not characterize acute toxicities whatsoever. Acute toxicities were evaluated as per ITT and protocol analyses (see  Supplementary Tables S4  and  S5  in the  Supplementary Material ). Of 280 patients from the IT94 study, 274 were evaluable for acute hematological toxicities. Single HDCT followed by AHCT probably results in little to no difference in neutropenia ≥ G3 of men with relapsed GCTs (RR 1.06, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.14; p = 0.134; moderate-certainty evidence). However, single HDCT with AHCT likely increases febrile neutropenia ≥ G3 (RR 1.57, 95%CI 1.30 to 1.91; p < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) as well as thrombocytopenia ≥ G3 (RR 1.54, 95%CI 1.30 to 1.82; p < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) of men with relapsed GCTs. Mardiak’s study found no evidence that HDCT, followed by AHCT, increases acute hematological toxicities of patients with GCTs (see  Supplementary Table S6  in the  Supplementary Material ). This is probably explained by the fact that the control arm did not receive the standard dose of VIP but 1.6 VIP (i.e., etoposide 600 mg/m 2 , ifosfamide 8,000 mg/m 2 , and cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 ). See Meta-Analysis of Febrile Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia considering all included studies ( Figures 9 ,  10 ). Meta-analysis of pooled estimates of febrile neutropenia ≥ G3. Meta-analysis of pooled estimates of thrombocytopenia ≥ G3. Of 280 patients from the IT94 trial, 274 were evaluable for acute gastrointestinal toxicities. Single HDCT followed by AHCT may result in a large increase in nausea/vomiting ≥ G3 (RR 3.30, 95%CI 2.03 to 5.38; p < 0.001; low-certainty evidence), diarrhea ≥ G3 (RR 9.36, 95%CI 2.22 to 39.42; p = 0.002; low-certainty evidence), and mucositis ≥ G3 (RR 16.43, 95%CI 5.25 to 51.39; p < 0.001; low-certainty evidence) of men with relapsed GCTs. The IT94 trial reported 9/138 deaths due to toxicities in the experimental arm and 4/136 deaths in the control arm. The causes of death due to toxicity can be found in  Supplementary Table S7  in the  Supplementary Material . Based on data from Pico’s trial, we concluded that single HDCT followed by AHCT may increase death due to toxicity of men with relapsed GCTs (RR 2.22, 95%CI 0.70 to 7.03; p = 0.176; low-certainty evidence). Mardiak’s and Faure-Conter’s studies reported one death each. In the first study, the patient died due to toxicity (i.e., septic shock) during the first cycle of 1.6 VIP. On the contrary, one patient died of renal and myocardial acute failure after receiving CarboPEC in Faure-Conter’s trial."

        "content": "The main objective of this SR and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of HDCT followed by AHCT versus CDCT in improving OS in men with relapsed or refractory GCTs. Three out of four studies were used to assess prespecified outcomes: one randomized ( 13 ) and two non-randomized prospective controlled trials ( 32 ,  33 ). The IT94 trial ( 13 ) enrolled 280 participants, 263 of whom had data available for OS analysis. This study compared VIP/VeIP for four cycles with VIP/VeIP for 3 cycles, followed by one cycle of CarboPEC with AHCT. The IT94 study excluded patients with refractory disease. Based on the data provided by this study, we concluded that single HDCT followed by AHCT may have little to no effect on OS in relapsed GCT patients. Non-randomized trials revealed contradictory results. Mardiak’s trial used three cycles of HDCT followed by AHCT. It showed that HDCT improves survival compared with CDCT. However, the OS benefit was lost at the 2-year assessment. On the contrary, Faure-Conter’s trial did not show statistical evidence that single HDCT improves OS in patients with GCTs. Data from the IT94 trial ( 13 ) were utilized to produce the main conclusions about EFS, response rate, and acute toxicities. However, we conducted additional exploratory analysis using data from the included non-randomized studies ( 32 ,  33 ). Based on the IT94 trial, we determined that single HDCT followed by AHCT may improve the EFS of men with relapsed GCTs. No significant differences were found in ORR and failure comparing single HDCT followed by AHCT with CDCT. Exploring the impact of data from included no-randomized trials on ORR and failure, we found no evidence that HDCT followed by AHCT improves CR or decreases failure. As for acute toxicity ≥ G3, 274 out of 280 participants had data accessible for analysis. We concluded that single HDCT followed by AHCT likely increases the risk of developing febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and may result in a large increase in nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis. Exploring the influence of data from included no-randomized trials on febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, we found that our conclusions did not change much. Finally, we also found that single HDCT followed by AHCT may increase death due to toxicity. The conclusion about the primary outcome was supported by very-low-certainty evidence; thus, it should be interpreted cautiously. All secondary outcomes were exploratory and, therefore, are only hypothesis-generating. The certainty of evidence was very low for OS due to study limitations and imprecision. Despite this, the IT94 trial provides the best available prospective evidence comparing the efficacy of single HDCT followed by AHCT with CDCT in men with relapsed GCTs. The certainty of evidence-supported secondary outcomes such as EFS, response rate, acute gastrointestinal toxicity, and death due to toxicity was rated as low due to trial limitations and imprecision. On the contrary, due to study limitations, we rated the certainty of evidence for neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia as moderate. Despite that we included two non-randomized prospective controlled trials in our systematic review, data from these studies were not utilized to build the main conclusions. According to the ROBINS-I tool, the risk of bias in Mardiak’s and Faure-Conter’s studies was considered critical. Additionally, Mardiak’s trial had a small sample size (n = 25), included people with treatment-naïve GCTs (n = 9), and did not provide sufficient data to calculate time-to-event outcomes for relapsed/refractory GCT population. Faure-Conter’s trial also had a small sample size (n = 19) and included male and female infants (n = 9) as well as participants with ovarian and sacrococcygeal primary sites. Finally, it is worth noting that included studies used HDCT and CDCT regimens, which are no longer utilized at high-volume cancer centers with experience in the management of GCTs ( 10 ,  17 ). In view of the very-low-certainty evidence supporting OS, the current body of prospective data does not allow a definitive conclusion. The results of this SR provide a clear overview of the currently available prospective data regarding the value of HDCT with AHCT compared to CDCT in men with relapsed GCTs. We used a broad search strategy to identify eligible studies, searching three citation databases, two trial registers, and conference proceedings and checking the reference lists of previous reviews. We also considered non-English studies and used Google Translate when required. However, although it is unlikely that we missed eligible randomized controlled trials, we cannot be sure regarding non-randomized prospective controlled studies due to the search strategy utilized, issues related to indexing this type of study, and the quality of reporting. Regardless of these problems, it is improbable that we had missed a non-randomized prospective controlled study with a low risk of bias. In addition, we were not able to find updated data from included studies. Other limitations were that only one reviewer performed the screening of the studies and assessed the certainty of the evidence. In addition, another source of potential bias was the decision to group different regimens of HDCT and CDCT in one experimental and one control arm, respectively. We made this pragmatic choice with the aim of conducting a subgroup analysis to further explain this source of variability. Nonetheless, we did not perform a meta-analysis of OS for the reason mentioned above. As we stated above, the aim of our systematic review was to assess the efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation versus conventional-dose chemotherapy in improving survival and other patient-important outcomes. Compared with previous reviews, ours was focused on summarizing the best available prospective evidence and addressing outcomes such as quality of life and toxicities. The only available phase III randomized controlled trial (i.e., IT94 study), which compared CDCT with HDCT followed AHCT, failed to show a significant survival benefit from HDCT. Single-center studies conducted at high-volume academic cancer centers did show promising results utilizing HDCT with AHCT in this population ( 16 ,  17 ). Along the same lines, Lorch and colleagues found that HDCT, given as the first salvage therapy, improved PFS and OS in patients with relapsed/refractory germ cell tumors compared with CDCT regardless of IPFSG prognostic category except among low-risk patients ( 35 ). In contrast, a recent retrospective study found that patients with favorable and unfavorable-risk disease as per Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) criteria can also achieve durable responses with initial salvage TIP ( 36 ). These results show that experience matters, perhaps reflecting a better selection of patients, surgical expertise in managing residual mass, and the ability to safely deliver HDCT followed by AHCT. It is well known that death rates due to HDCT-related toxicity are largely related to expertise, as shown by Lorch et al. ( 35 ). Systematic reviews have been published on this topic so far. They have shown results in keeping with our findings. For instance, Husnain et al. ( 18 ) failed to show any significant results for overall survival in patients with relapsed/refractory germ cell tumors treated with HDCT with AHCT. Petrelli and colleagues ( 22 ) found comparable efficacy when CDCT and HDCT were used as salvage therapies in relapsed/refractory germ cell tumors. Interestingly, Bin Riaz et al. ( 19 ) established that a single cycle of HDCT with AHCT does not improve survival compared with CDCT. However, the authors did find that two or three cycles of HDCT play a positive role in this population."

        "content": "Accounting for 95% of testicular cancers, testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common solid tumor in men between the ages of 20 and 44 years with an increasing incidence over the past 20+ years ( 1 , 2 ). Modern treatment paradigms include surgery, platin-based chemotherapy, and radiation therapy and afford high survival rates exceeding 95% for all men diagnosed with testicular cancer. An important component of this management paradigm is retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), an established albeit complex surgical procedure serving as an option in the primary treatment of high-risk clinical stage 1 (CS1) and low-volume clinical stage 2 (CS2) nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs), as well as in the post-chemotherapy setting for residual retroperitoneal masses >1 cm in NSGCTs >3 cm with PET avidity in men with seminoma ( 1 - 3 ). Recently, RPLND is being investigated in the primary treatment of stage II seminoma ( 4 )."

        "content": "Primary PLND performed in an open setting (O-RPLND) is the gold standard for surgical management of the retroperitoneum for men with early-stage (stage I–IIB) NSGCT. When performed at high-volume institutions, O-RPLND is associated with excellent oncologic outcomes and low recurrence rates but lengthy hospital stays and significant morbidity including risks of ejaculatory dysfunction, blood loss, ileus, bowel obstruction, chylous ascites, visceral injury, great vessel ligation, and a large surgical scar—all of which can deter patients from pursuing surgery ( 5 ). Alternative management strategies for stage I NSGCT include surveillance and adjuvant, platinum-based chemotherapy. While all management strategies for men with Stage I NSGCT are associated with excellent cancer-specific survival rates (approaching 100%), each management strategy is associated with different exposure rates to chemotherapy (30–100%) ( 6 ). Surveillance is the preferred management option for low risk CS1 disease based on the NCCN and AUA guidelines, but any recurrence leads patients to multiple cycles of chemotherapy ( 1 , 7 ). Furthermore, not all patients are able to deal with the uncertainty behind long term surveillance ( 8 ). Adjuvant chemotherapy offers a high cure rate with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin, but can results in overtreatment along with significant long-term morbidity including neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, hypogonadism, infertility, and secondary malignancy ( 9 ). Increasing awareness of long-term toxicities associated with chemotherapy has shifted the paradigm from “cure all” to “minimize toxicity” for many patients and providers. While RPLND may overtreat many patients with stage I NSGCT, it remains an excellent option to minimize exposure to chemotherapy—especially in men with high-risk of relapse (i.e., stage IB). Primary RPLND for stage I NSGCT allows for accurate staging information in conjunction with avoiding the >20% relapse rate of patients on surveillance and chemotherapy associated morbidity ( 8 ). In a phase III randomized study of RPLND versus primary chemotherapy, 37% of patients undergoing chemotherapy experienced grade III or IV toxicity relative to only 9% of patients undergoing RPLND ( 10 ). However, patients undergoing RPLND had a recurrence rate of 8% compared with 0.5% for chemotherapy. RPLND will overtreatment some patients, but notably 25–35% of patients who present without radiographic evidence of lymph node pathology will have occult metastasis ( 11 ). In men with Stage IIA-B NSGCT, primary RPLND offers a greater than 50% chance of cure without chemotherapy—an appealing prospect for many patients, especially those with elements of teratoma. Thus, surgeons have sought to improve the morbidity and hospital stays associated with O-RPLND with the advent of minimally invasive RPLND while attempting to carry forward its benefits."

        "content": "Initially developed to improve staging of the retroperitoneum, laparoscopic RPLND (L-RPLND) was first performed in 1992 ( 12 ). Since 1992, numerous studies demonstrate L-RPLND to have durable long-term oncologic control, nerve sparing capability, less blood loss, shorter post-operative hospital stays, and fewer complications compared with O-RPLND ( 13 ). However, L-RPLND is a technically challenging operation and the existing literature represents highly select patient cohorts. In these select cohorts, lower lymph node yield is lower than O-RPLND and oncologic outcomes are obscured by high rates of adjuvant chemotherapy—based on oncologic trends during this time period ( 13 ). The first robotic RPNLD (R-RPLND) was performed in 2006 ( 14 ). The rationale for the transition was to better replicate open techniques and improve upon the shortcomings created by the technical challenges of pure laparoscopy. Preliminary results demonstrate R-RPLND as non-inferior to O-RPLND and L-RPLND in terms of early oncologic control and safety. R-RPLND has become an important option for CS1 and CS2 NSGCT as well as a feasible strategy for post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal masses. In this article, we discuss the technique behind R-RPLND, its role as primary management of CS1 and CS2 NSGCT and the current status in the post-chemotherapy setting."

        "section_name": "Robotic RPLND technique",
        "content": "R-RPLND is performed using the da Vinci robotic system, with the studies with greater than or equal to 10 patients highlighted in  Table 1  utilizing the Si, X, and Xi system ( 14 - 22 ). Of note, our institution has transitioned from the Xi system and currently performs R-RPLND with the da Vinci single-port (SP) system, which has facilitated surgery necessitating only a single docking. The surgery is performed via a transperitoneal approach with the patient positioned in either a modified flank position or supine position with the patient placed in Trendelenburg, with the authors’ preferred approach being the latter ( 15 - 18 ). In this approach, a Veress needle is used to achieve pneumoperitoneum after which robotic trocars and assistant ports are placed. Of note, bilateral and nerve-sparing dissections can be performed from either method of patient positioning ( 15 - 18 ). Studies with greater than or equal to 10 patients are highlighted in bold. CS1, clinical stage 1; CS2, clinical stage 2; EBL, estimated blood loss; LOS, length of stay. With the Xi system, the robotic ports are placed in a horizontal and linear fashion at approximately the level of the umbilicus, while port placement for the SP system entails a single port placed at the umbilicus. An assistant port is typically placed in the right lower quadrant, with a second assistant port occasionally placed in the contralateral lower quadrant. Much controversy exists regarding the use of templates in early-stage testicular cancer and a full discussion is beyond the scope of this review, with the largest R-RPLND studies showing feasibility of both the unilateral and bilateral templates ( 15 - 18 ). It is the authors’ preference to perform a unilateral template for men with CS1 disease and bilateral template for CS2 identified radiographically or operatively. Nerve-sparing is performed in all case where technically feasible. The robotic approach replicates open RPLND techniques. The ipsilateral colon is reflected to reveal the retroperitoneum, with dissection performed following the boundaries of the iliac bifurcation inferiorly, ureter laterally, and renal vein boundaries superiorly. Once the gonadal vein is identified it is ligated at the level of its origin, with the remainder of the ipsilateral spermatic cord dissected free from the inguinal ring. The left-sided dissection template includes lymph node packets from the left common iliac nodes, preaortic, paraaortic, and retroaortic regions. The right-sided dissection template includes lymph nodes from the paracaval, interaortocaval, and preaortic spaces. During dissection the sympathetic chain and postganglionic nerve fibers are identified and preserved. To prevent postoperative lymphatic leak, a combination of electrocautery and hem-o-lok clips are used to clamp lymph node packets. To facilitate retrocaval and retroaortic lymph node packets, control of lumbar vessels via ligation is performed with surgical clips, ties, or suture ligation. The robotic system’s wristed instruments allow for improved dexterity to allow for dissection of all retrocaval and retroaortic tissue. Furthermore, nerve dissection and preservation are made easier by the magnified camera view and camera angle. Once hemostasis is achieved, fibrin sealant can be applied to lymphatic beds to help prevent lymphatic leaks. We do not typically place a drain at our center. After recovery in a post-acute care unit, patients are transferred to the floor. Diet is quickly advanced from clear liquids (night of surgery) to fat-free regular diet (day after surgery). A low-fat diet is initiated in the hospital and accompanied by a nutrition consult. The fat content is regularly advanced over 4 weeks to decrease the risk of lymphatic leak. Patients are discharged when they are ambulatory, tolerating a regular diet and pain is well-controlled; typically post-operative day one or two. We encourage patients to remain out of school or work for two weeks and to avoid strenuous physical activity for three to four weeks."

        "content": "To date, there are multiple works published detailing the outcomes and complications of primary R-RPLND ( 23 ). We highlight the four largest series so far in  Table 1 . Of note, all four studies take place at high-volume academic centers with experienced robotic surgeons and are retrospective in design, and to date no completely prospective trial regarding R-RPLND has been performed to the best of our knowledge. R-RPLND as a minimally invasive urologic surgery is expected to have longer operative time but less blood loss, shorter recovery time, and decreased hospital stay than its open counterpart. R-RPLND across the four studies had median operative times ranging from 235–311 minutes, much greater than compared with the median operative times in a large metanalysis of both L-RPLND (204 minutes) and O-RPLND (186 minutes) ( 13 , 15 - 18 ). Median blood loss across the four studies ranged from 50-100 mL, much lower than the range of 150–325 mL found in different open series ( 24 - 27 ). When compared with the laparoscopic approach, Harris  et al.  found similar blood loss with R-RPLND (75 mL; IQR, 50–100 mL) and L-RPLND (125 mL; IQR, 50–150 mL) ( 15 ). Like with other minimally invasive surgeries involving insufflation, this decreased blood loss is likely secondary to the increased abdominal pressure controlling venous bleeding. Median length of stay ranged from 1–3 days for R-RPLND, shorter than that reported for both L-RPLND (3.3 days) and O-RPLND (6.6 days) ( 13 ). This is likely secondary to a smaller incision and decreased postoperative ileus, resulting in patients with improved pain control who are able to get out of bed and walk earlier and regain bowel function. Notably, conversion to open was an uncommon occurrence (3.4% of all patients in the four studies), which is similar to that noted for L-RPLND (3.7%) ( 13 ). One of the most glaring drawbacks to O-RPLND is its relatively high rate of complications (5%, 24%, and 7% for intraoperative, postoperative, and late complications respectively in one more recent series) ( 5 ). Recognizing the selection of favorable cases in the early adoption of R-RPLND, the reported major complication rates are low. Harris  et al.  reported 1 (6.2%) intraoperative complication, an aortic injury necessitating open conversion with successful open repair of the injury ( 15 ). Stepanian  et al.  reported having 1 (6.25%) intraoperative complication in their series consisting of a transected ureter that was subsequently repaired with success ( 16 ). Pearce  et al.  reports 2 (4.3%) intraoperative complications, a pancreatic injury that was recognized intraoperatively and managed with drain placement, and an aortic injury necessitating open conversion and subsequent successful repair ( 18 ). The rate of intraoperative complication was thus similar to that seen in open series, albeit difficult to properly compare given the low sample size of R-RPLND. The postoperative complication rate likewise is comparable to that of O-RPLND and L-RPLND. Harris  et al.  reported 1 (6.2%) postoperative complication (Clavien III) ( 15 ). Cheney  et al.  noted having only 1 (10%) postoperative complication (ileus) ( 17 ). Stepanian  et al.  report only 2 patients with retrograde ejaculation as postoperative complications ( 16 ). Finally, Pearce  et al.  reported having 4 (8.5%) postoperative complications ( 18 ). Two were Clavien grade I (chylous ascites resolving with medium chain triglyceride diet, ileus requiring nasogastric tube decompression) and 2 were Clavien Grade III (body wall hematoma requiring 1 unit of packed red blood cells, chylous ascites requiring a single course of paracentesis) ( 18 ). Pearce  et al. ’s complication rate of 8.5% is comparable to the complication rate of L-RPLND in a metanalysis (15.5%) and O-RPLND in more recent series (7–24%) ( 5 , 26 ). While not reported in any of the other highlighted studies, 4.3% ( 2 ) patients in the Pearce  et al.  series experienced chylous ascites, with one patient requiring paracentesis. This high rate is surprising, as one would expect the improvements in visualization and dexterity associated with robotic surgery to allow for improved ligation of lymphatics. It is unclear if this high rate is secondary to small sample size, but suggests that surgeons must be aware and able to manage this complication in R-RPLND patients. The insufflation pressures during laparoscopy may obscure small lymphatic leaks leading to a slightly higher rate in the robotic experience. Subramanian  et al.  reported that 18% of patients undergoing O-RPLND experienced postoperative ileus compared with only 2% of patients undergoing R-RPLND in Pearce  et al. ’s cohort ( 5 , 18 ). Given the significant economic burden of postoperative ileus studied in other types of surgeries, this is a significant benefit of the robotic approach, likely secondary to differences in bowel mobilization, less morbid incision with improved pain control, and quicker return to ambulation. Notably, all series reported excellent reports of antegrade ejaculation, ranging from 90–100%, with Pearce  et al.  noting an antegrade ejaculation rate of 96% ( 15 - 18 ). Potential long-term sexual dysfunction can cause significant morbidity for testicular cancer survivors, with these results indicating that R-RPLND can replicate nerve-sparing procedures. Early oncologic outcomes are favorable in the reported literature. The lymph node yield, which can represent the extent of node dissection, ranged from 19.5 to 26 across the four studies—slightly lower relative to O-RPLND (ranging from 28–38 in different studies) ( 28 , 29 ). In spite of this, recurrence rates fared well and ranged from 80% to 100%, with the largest study comprising 47 patients (which includes our institution’s patient cohort) by Pearce  et al.  having a recurrence free rate of 97% over a median follow-up time of 16 months ( 18 ). In the Pearce  et al.  cohort, 42 patients (89.4%) were CS1 while the remaining 5 (10.6%) were CS2. Of the 8 patients (17%) with positive lymph nodes, 5 underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. No patients experienced recurrence in the Stepanian  et al.  cohort comprising 11 CS1 patients and 5 CS2 patients ( 16 ). Thirty-eight percent (n=6) patients in that primary RPLND cohort had positive lymph nodes, with 2 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. 8 patients (32%) from this study had positive lymph nodes on pathology, with only 2 out of 8 patients received adjuvant therapy secondary to embryonal carcinoma noted on final pathology. Of the remaining 6 patients with positive lymph nodes, three were positive for teratoma and thus did not need any adjuvant therapy. Of the recurrences in all four early outcome studies, none were retroperitoneal in nature ( 15 - 18 ). These early outcomes are promising and comparable to the recurrence-free rates of O-RPLND (92.5%) and L-RPLND (95.4%), with no reported retroperitoneal recurrences ( 13 ). Unfortunately, comparing open, laparoscopic and robotic series is challenging given these studies use slightly different surgical techniques, vary in utilization of adjuvant chemotherapy, and have relatively short follow-up time. Accruing data from these series will determine the oncologic efficacy of R-RPLND. Recent literature indicates oncologic concerns with R-RPLND. Calaway  et al.  present a case series of 5 patients who underwent R-RPLND with atypical patterns of recurrence for patients with low risk NSGCT ( 30 ). In the series, four patients presented with low-risk NSGCT and 1 with intermediate-risk NSGCT; three underwent primary R-RPLND and two underwent post-chemotherapy R-RPLND. Recurrences were discovered at a median time of 259 days (92–503 days) with one in-field recurrence and four out-of-field recurrences (pericolic space with invasion into the colon, peritoneal carcinomatosis in addition to a perinephric mass, large volume liver lesions with suprahilar disease extending in the retrocrural space, and lymph nodes in the celiac axis). All patients underwent additional chemotherapy and three patients required additional surgery. One patient died of disease. This report casts a concerning shadow over the oncologic outcomes of R-RPLND. It is challenging to discern the impact of robotic technology on oncologic outcomes when the denominator of recurrences is unknown, surgical technique, and surgeon experience are unknown. With more data, the efficacy of R-RPLND will be determined. Given the excellent oncologic outcomes of O-RPLND, any deviation from the standard of care requires careful study before widespread adoption at less experienced centers. Therefore, we recommend R-RPLND only be performed by surgeons with significant experience in testicular cancer, RPLND and robotic surgery—a stance endorsed by American Urological Association Guidelines ( 7 )."

        "section_name": "Post-chemotherapy R-RPLND",
        "content": "Postchemotherapy RPLND (PC-RPLND) presents several challenges not present for primary RPLND and that make the role of R-RPLND more dubious. PC-RPLND is notable for high complication rates and concomitant surgery (including vascular repair, bowel resections, nephrectomy, etc.) given the desmoplastic reaction induced by chemotherapy and subsequent merging of tissue planes complicating tissue dissection ( 31 , 32 ). Importantly, oncologic outcomes following PC-RPLND are dependent on quality surgery as options for salvage are limited ( 33 ). PC-RPLND is not performed robotically at our center given the concerns expressed above, nevertheless a number of centers report preliminary outcomes regarding postchemotherapy robotic RPLND (PC-R-RPLND) in small series. The studies reporting outcomes for PC-R-RPLND are summarized in  Table 2  ( 16 , 17 , 34 - 40 ). Studies with greater than or equal to 10 patients are highlighted in bold. CS1, clinical stage 1; CS2, clinical stage 2; EBL, estimated blood loss; LOS, length of stay. Cheney  et al.  compared eight men undergoing PC-R-RPLND with ten men who underwent primary RPLND ( 17 ). There was no retroperitoneal recurrence at a median follow up of 22 months. There was no difference in lymph node yield (primary 22, postchemotherapy 18), estimated blood loss (primary 100, postchemotherapy 313), and length of hospital stay (primary 2.75 days, postchemotherapy 2.2 days). However, operative time for PC-R-RPLND (369 minutes) was significantly longer than for primary R-RPLND (311 minutes) and two men undergoing PC-R-RPLND (22.3%) were converted to open surgery. Kamel  et al.  retrospectively reported 12 patients undergoing PC-R-RPLND. One patient required open conversion, two (18.2%) minor complications (postoperative ileus and upper limb neuropathy) and one (9.1%) major complication (aortic injury) were reported ( 34 ). Singh  et al.  reported 13 patients with clinical stage II or higher disease who underwent postchemotherapy R-RPLND. Three patients (23.1%) had teratoma in their lymph nodes. Over a median of 23 months (range, 3–58 months), there were no systemic or retroperitoneal recurrences ( 35 ). Ten complications were reported including one intraoperative aortic injury, four (30.8%) chyle leaks, and five patients with post-operative ileus. Additionally, Overs  et al.  reported on 11 patients who underwent postchemotherapy R-RPLND, ten with CS2 and one with CS3 ( 36 ). They reported no intraoperative complications, and reported only 1 (9.1%) postoperative complication (chylous ascites). 72.7% of their patients reported normal, antegrade ejaculation 1 month after surgery. At a median 2 years from surgery, no patients had recurrence. Lymph node yield in this series was low (median 7) and attributed to utilization of modified unilateral lymph node templates. Most recently, in the largest series to date, Li  et al.  retrospectively compared 30 patients who underwent R-PC-RPLND with 63 patients who underwent open PC-RPLND (O-PC-RPLND) ( 38 ). Baseline clinicopathologic patient characteristic differences between R-PC-PRLND and O-PC-RPLND reflected careful selection for robotic surgery and included lower clinical stage (P=0.006), favorable International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group classification (P=0.01), marked response to chemotherapy (P=0.002), and smaller retroperitoneal mass postchemotherapy (P=0.001) ( 38 ). O-PC-RPLND (375 minutes) and R-PC-RPLND (388 minutes) had similar operative time, with significantly more EBL in the O-PC-RPLND group (825  vs.  235 mL; P<0.001). Similar to primary RPLND, the median length of stay for O-PC-RPLND was greater than that of R-PC-RPLND (7  vs.  2 days; P<0.001). The complication rate was high (33%), and the difference between the R-PC-RPLND (20%) and O-PC-RPLND (39.7%) group did not reach statistical significance, potentially due to the effects of small sample size. Three patients required conversion to open surgery for a failure to progress secondary to inadequate visualization (n=2) and inability to control a vascular injury (n=1). The major complications after R-PC-RPLND included chylous ascites (n=1), pneumothorax (n=1), and colon perforation (n=1). Oncologic outcomes were similar between groups, with the authors not finding that surgical approach significantly predicted time to recurrence for these patients. Two patients (6.7%) required additional procedures by consulting surgical services for maximal oncologic control. The existing literature regarding PC-R-RPLND is most notable for high rates of chylous ascites and short oncologic follow-up. Furthermore, in order to achieve maximal oncologic control, ancillary surgical procedures have been shown to be required in the O-PC-RPLND literature and were noted as necessary by Li  et al.  for R-PC-RPLND ( 32 , 38 ). This could necessitate conversion to open surgery given the consulting surgeon’s familiarity with robotic surgery or degree of emergency, a risk that can theoretically be minimized by excluding patients from R-PC-RPLND who are at higher risk of requiring adjuvant surgical intervention (e.g., retroperitoneal mass >5 cm, intermediate or poor IGCCCG classification) ( 32 ). As stated above, we do not routinely perform R-RPLND in the post-chemotherapy setting and recommend that these surgeries only be performed in select settings by experts in testicular cancer, RPLND, and robotic surgery. Accruing data from larger and more robust prospective studies are required before R-RPLND can be considered routine in the post-chemotherapy setting."

Larger, prospective studies with longer follow-up are necessary to better evaluate oncologic outcomes and concerns regarding patterns of recurrence. PC-R-RPLND is supported by a few small studies with limited follow-up with reports of significant morbidity (chyle leak, postoperative ileus), suggesting that this approach needs further study before widespread adoption. Given the significant technical complexities of patient selection and the operation, R-RPLND should only be performed by surgeons with expertise in testicular cancer, RPLND and robotic surgery."

    "abstract": "Testicular cancer has become the paradigm of adult-onset cancer survivorship, due to the young age at diagnosis and 10-year relative survival of 95%. This clinical review presents the current status of various treatment-related complications experienced by long-term testicular cancer survivors (TCS) free of disease for 5 or more years after primary treatment. Cardiovascular disease and second malignant neoplasms represent the most common potentially life-threatening late effects. Other long-term adverse outcomes include neuro- and ototoxicity, pulmonary complications, nephrotoxicity, hypogonadism, infertility, and avascular necrosis. Future research efforts should focus on delineation of the genetic underpinning of these long-term toxicities to understand their biologic basis and etiopathogenetic pathways, with the goal of developing targeted prevention and intervention strategies to optimize risk-based care and minimize chronic morbidities. In the interim, health care providers should advise TCS to adhere to national guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease risk factors, as well as to adopt behaviors consistent with a healthy lifestyle, including smoking cessation, a balanced diet, and a moderate to vigorous intensity exercise program. TCS should also follow national guidelines for cancer screening as currently applied to the general population.",

        "content": "Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common cancer, affecting young men aged 18–39 years [ 1 ]. Due to effective cisplatin-based chemotherapy introduced in the 1970s [ 2 ], TC is highly curable with a 10-year relative survival approaching 95% [ 3 ,  4 ]. However, treatment-related complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), second malignant neoplasms (SMN), neuro- and ototoxicity, pulmonary complications, nephrotoxicity, hypogonadism, infertility, avascular necrosis, cognitive impairment, anxiety/depression, and chronic cancer-related fatigue, accompany these remarkable successes [ 5 – 7 ]. These adverse outcomes of TC and its therapy have emerged as important issues for this young cohort of survivors. In this review article, we will focus on toxicities due to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced by long-term survivors of TC, which are defined as individuals who are disease-free 5 years or more after primary treatment [ 8 ]. Due to sparse data, the risks of long-term toxicities after single-dose carboplatin for stage I seminoma or one to two cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) for stage I nonseminoma will not be reviewed."

        "content": "A few hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of CVD in TC survivors (TCS), including the direct vascular damage hypothesis, the indirect hypothesis, and more recently the multiple-hit hypothesis [ 9 ,  10 ]. The direct vascular damage hypothesis proposes that cisplatin-based chemotherapy causes direct damage to the vascular endothelium [ 9 ]. In vitro exposure of endothelial cells to cisplatin or bleomycin causes cytokine release and cytotoxicity [ 11 ,  12 ]. Von Willebrand factor, an inflammatory marker released by endothelial cells in response to vascular damage, increases in TC patients during chemotherapy [ 13 ]. Other markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are also evident after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, including fibrinogen, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [ 14 ,  15 ]. Microalbuminuria is present in an increased number of TC patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy [ 14 ,  16 ], which is a clinical manifestation of systemic vascular dysfunction that independently predicts for vascular events, including stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) [ 17 ]. In one study, microalbuminuria persisted in 22% of TCS treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy after a median follow-up of 14 years [ 16 ]. A prior investigation [ 15 ] showed that the carotid intimal medial thickness of TC patients, which correlates with increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents and MI [ 18 ], significantly increased during a 3.5-month course of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This rate of increase was significantly higher than the annual change observed in carotid intimal medial thickness in the general population. Acute alterations in diastolic heart function were reported in a study [ 19 ] of 14 TC patients three months after initiation of 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy with BEP; these included significant decreases in the left ventricular end-diastolic and stroke volumes. Other suggested mechanisms of direct vascular damage include cisplatin-induced vasospasm due to hypomagnesemia [ 20 – 23 ] and increased formation of procoagulant endothelial microparticles released by endothelial cells, triggering thrombin generation and hypercoagulability [ 24 ,  25 ]. Raynaud phenomenon is another clinical manifestation of vascular damage and is estimated to be present in approximately 25% to 61% of TCS [ 26 – 30 ]. The onset of symptoms from Raynaud phenomenon generally begins within 4 to 12 months of chemotherapy, with 25% experiencing these symptoms up to 20 years [ 14 ]. Bleomycin is strongly associated with the development of Raynaud phenomenon. In a randomized study [ 31 ] of 395 patients with good-risk metastatic nonseminoma, 8% of patients randomized to BEP developed Raynaud phenomenon compared to none undergoing etoposide and cisplatin (EP). Vinblastine and cisplatin are other chemotherapeutic agents that may contribute to this toxicity [ 28 – 30 ,  32 ]. The indirect hypothesis postulates that cisplatin-based chemotherapy increases the prevalence of CVD risk factors in TCS, resulting in increased CVD events [ 9 ]. Multiple studies [ 14 ,  16 ,  30 ,  33 – 40 ] have reported increased frequency of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome among TC patients after treatment with chemotherapy compared to surgery-only comparison groups or controls derived from the general population ( Table 1 ). Although several studies [ 36 ,  38 ,  41 ] showed that metabolic syndrome and its individual components are associated with testosterone deficiency and hypogonadism, most TCS with CVD risk factors have normal testosterone levels [ 33 ]. Decreased testosterone levels may cause endothelial dysfunction, impair vascular smooth muscle reactivity, increase intima and media thickness of vessels, and increase synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines [ 42 – 44 ]. In an investigation by Haugnes et al. [ 33 ], relationships with both hypogonadism and cumulative dose of cisplatin and metabolic syndrome were evaluated among 1135 Norwegian TCS. Compared to the surgery group, TCS who received a cumulative dose of cisplatin >850 mg had a significant 2.8-fold increased odds of metabolic syndrome, with both total serum testosterone and smoking history (≥20 pack-years) being independent predictive factors in multiple regression models. A multiple-hit hypothesis that encompasses both the direct and indirect hypotheses has recently been proposed to explain the elevated risk of CVD among TCS [ 10 ,  45 ]. This model hypothesizes that multiple factors interact synergistically to increase the risks of CVD among TCS, including orchiectomy-derived subclinical hypogonadism, chemotherapy-induced vascular injury, chemotherapy-related disturbance of metabolic homeostasis, and other TC treatment-related toxicities [ 10 ]. The relative risk of CVD among TCS treated with chemotherapy is 1.4- to 7.1-fold significantly higher compared to the general population or to those managed with surveillance only [ 16 ,  34 ,  35 ,  46 ,  47 ]. A British study [ 35 ] of 390 TCS treated with chemotherapy between 1982 and 1992 at a median follow-up of 9.7 years showed a 7% incidence of angina, MI or sudden cardiac death, with an elevated age-adjusted relative risk (RR) of 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–5.8) when compared with TC patients treated with surgery alone. In a retrospective study [ 46 ] of a nationwide cohort of 2707 5-year TCS in the Netherlands (1965–1995) after a median follow-up of 17.6 years, cisplatin-based chemotherapy (cisplatin, vinblastine, bleomycin (PVB) or BEP) increased the risk of CVD by 1.7-fold (95% CI 1.1–2.5) when compared with age and sex-matched data in the general Dutch population. To determine CVD risk after modern-era cisplatin-based chemotherapy in TC patients, Haugnes et al. [ 34 ] evaluated the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and long-term incidence of CVD among 990 5-year TC survivors (median follow-up: 19 years). All cytotoxic treatment groups (radiation only, chemotherapy only, and combined radiation/chemotherapy) had significantly increased prevalence of usage of antihypertensive medications compared with age-matched male controls in the general population. The odds of diabetes were higher in the radiation (odds ratio (OR) 2.3; 95% CI 1.5–3.7) and radiation/chemotherapy groups (OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.4–10.9) compared to controls [ 34 ]. Using age-adjusted Cox regression analyses, increased risks of atherosclerotic disease were reported in the radiation only (hazard ratio (HR) 2.3; 95% CI 1.04–5.3), chemotherapy only (HR 2.6; 95% CI 1.1–5.9), and combined radiation/chemotherapy cohorts (HR 4.8; 95% CI 1.6–14.4) compared to those managed with surgery only [ 34 ]. Treatment with BEP alone increased the risk of coronary artery disease by 5.7-fold (95% CI 1.9–17.1) compared with surgery only, while the risk for MI increased by 3.1-fold (95% CI 1.2–7.7) compared with age-matched male controls [ 34 ]. Using age-adjusted Cox regression analyses, increased risks of atherosclerotic disease were reported after radiation only (HR 2.3; 95% CI 1.04–5.3), chemotherapy only (HR 2.6; 95% CI 1.1–5.9), and combined radiation/chemotherapy (HR 4.8; 95% CI 1.6–14.4) compared with surgery only (P-trend = 0.02) [ 34 ]. In particular, treatment with BEP alone increased CAD risk by 5.7-fold (95% CI 1.9–17.1) compared with surgery only and increased MI risk by 3.1-fold (95% CI 1.2–7.7) compared with age-matched male controls [ 34 ]. Several studies [ 48 – 50 ] have examined the extent to which increased CVD mortality might result from TC treatment. In an international population-based study [ 48 ] of 38,907 TCS (1943–2002) at a median follow-up of 10 years, a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.3–2.0) increased risk of mortality from all circulatory diseases was reported for those treated with chemotherapy after 1975. Another population-based study [ 49 ] using the SEER program (1973–2008) found that patients with either mediastinal or nonmediastinal extragonadal GCT had significantly increased 4.5-fold and 2.8-fold risks of CVD mortality, respectively, compared to patients with primary testicular GCT. The increased number of cycles of primary chemotherapy and additional salvage chemotherapy typically required to treat extragonadal TC were hypothesized to contribute to this higher risk, although detailed chemotherapy data were not available [ 49 ]. Recently, Fung et al. [ 50 ] reported a significant 5.3-fold increase in CVD mortality during the first year after chemotherapy in a population-based study of 15,006 TCS managed initially with either chemotherapy or surgery alone without radiotherapy during 1980–2010. In contrast, excess CVD mortality was not observed more than one year after chemotherapy, likely due to advances in cardiovascular disease management, as reflected in the 31% decline in US cardiovascular death rates from 2000 to 2010 [ 51 ]. In multivariable analyses, increased CVD mortality after chemotherapy was confined to the first year after TC diagnosis (HR 4.86; 95% CI, 1.25–32); distant disease ( P  < 0.05) and older age at diagnosis ( P  < 0.01) were independent risk factors [ 50 ]. Currently, there are no established evidence-based CVD screening recommendations developed specifically for TCS. In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released guidelines for the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk, the management of elevated cholesterol and increased body weight, and lifestyle modifications to reduce CVD risk in adults in the general population [ 52 ]. Health care professionals should monitor and modify cardiovascular risk factors of TCS by referring to these guidelines [ 52 ] and by leveraging TC diagnosis as a teachable moment to promote lifestyle changes, including smoking cessation, optimal nutrition, and a nonsedentary lifestyle [ 7 ,  53 ]."

        "content": "Syndromic, cancer treatment, and shared etiologic exposures are the major causative factors of SMN [ 54 ].  Figure 1  shows the influence of lifestyle factors, genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures, host effects, and a combination of influences, including gene-environment interactions in the development of SMN. Age at exposure and attained age are modifiers for the risks of selected SMN [ 55 ]. After receiving radiotherapy for TC treatment, TCS have significantly increased risks of leukemia [ 56 ] and solid cancers [ 46 ,  55 ,  57 – 59 ] ( Table 2 ). An international population-based study of 18,567 TCS reported a significantly 3-fold increased risk of leukemia after abdominal and pelvic radiotherapy with a mean dose of 10.9 Gy to active bone marrow [ 56 ]. The median latency for leukemia was 5.0 years with a quarter of survivors developing leukemia more than one decade later (maximum latency: 17.3 years) [ 56 ]. After radiation treatment, long-term TCS also have significantly 1.4 to 1.9-fold increased risks of second solid cancers compared to the general population ( Table 2 ) [ 46 ,  55 ,  57 ]. An international population-based investigation of 10-year TCS reported that the RR of SMN at sites included in typical infradiaphragmatic radiotherapy fields were significantly larger than risks at unexposed sites (RR 2.7 versus 1.6;  P  < 0.05), which remained elevated for more than 35 years. In another study [ 46 ], infradiaphragmatic radiotherapy administered at doses 40–50 Gray (Gy) compared with 26–35 Gy increased the HR for SMN from 2.3 to 3.2, respectively, when using a surgery-only group as control. Two recent studies of 5-year TCS reported a 5.9-fold increased risk of stomach cancer (95% CI 1.7–20.7) [ 58 ] and a 2.9-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer (95% CI 1.0–7.8) after radiotherapy [ 59 ]. The risks of stomach and pancreatic cancers increased with higher radiation doses to stomach [ 58 ] and pancreas [ 59 ], respectively ( P  trend < 0.001), and risks remained elevated for ≥20 years after exposure ( P  < 0.01) [ 58 ,  59 ]. Several other studies of TCS [ 46 ,  60 ,  61 ] similarly reported significant associations between radiotherapy and SMN risks. Cisplatin and etoposide are integral chemotherapeutic agents used in standard chemotherapy regimens to treat TC [ 62 ]. Both cisplatin and etoposide are associated with significantly elevated risks of secondary leukemia [ 56 ,  63 – 65 ]. An international nested case-control study [ 56 ] among TCS estimated a 3.2-fold risk of leukemia after cumulative cisplatin dose of 650 mg, although the excess risk was small with only 16 excess cases among 10,000 TC patients after 15 years of follow-up. The same study also reported a significant dose-response relationship between cumulative dose of cisplatin and leukemia risk after adjustment for radiation dose ( P  trend = 0.001) [ 56 ]. The 5-year cumulative incidence of leukemia is approximately 0.5% after a cumulative etoposide dose of <2000 mg/m 2  and 2.0% after a cumulative etoposide dose of ≥2000 mg/m 2  [ 65 ]. Most prior studies of second solid cancer focused on TCS treated before modern cisplatin-based chemotherapy became widely adopted prior to early 1980s ( Table 2 ) [ 10 ,  13 ,  22 ,  23 ]. Whereas an international series of more than 40,000 TCS showed a 1.8-fold (95% CI 1.3–2.5) significantly increased risk of second solid cancers among a subgroup of 10-year TCS who received initial chemotherapy during 1943–2001, three smaller epidemiologic studies [ 10 ,  39 ,  57 ] (ranging from 346 to 710 patients) found no significantly elevated risk of SMN after chemotherapy [ 27 ,  46 ,  66 ], though they may have inadequate statistical power. To evaluate the risks of second solid cancer among TCS treated in the modern era of cisplatin-based chemotherapy during 1980 to 2008, a recent large population-based investigation by Fung et al. [ 67 ] of more than 12,000 TCS reported a 1.4-fold significantly increased risk of solid cancers after initial treatment with chemotherapy compared to those who underwent initial surgery alone. Significantly increased three- to seven-fold risks of cancers of the kidney (standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 3.4), thyroid (SIR 4.4), and soft tissue (SIR 7.5) were also observed. After chemotherapy, elevated risks of solid cancer were reported in most follow-up periods with a median latency of 12.5 years, including at more than 20 years after treatment (SIR 1.54; 95% CI 0.96–2.3). However, detailed information on cytotoxic drug name and dose were not available [ 67 ]. TCS should follow national guidelines for cancer screening as applied to the general population, given their increased risks of SMN [ 53 ]. Earlier or additional cancer screening may be clinically indicated in TCS deemed at high risk due to prior treatment history and/or health habits [ 53 ]. In addition, health care providers should advise TCS of the modest 15-year cumulative risk (1.9%) of metachronous contralateral testicular cancer [ 68 ]."

        "section_name": "4. Neurotoxicity",
        "content": "Approximately 20 to 40% of long-term TCS experience symptoms of peripheral neuropathy after cisplatin-based chemotherapy [ 28 ,  29 ,  69 ]. Common clinical manifestations of peripheral neuropathy include numbness, tingling, and a decrease in vibratory sense in distal extremities [ 70 ]. The cumulative dose of cisplatin administered affects the incidence of peripheral neuropathy. At a median of 11 years after TC treatment, 46% of TCS in a population-based long-term Norwegian survey self-reported paresthesia after ≥5 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy compared to 28% after 1 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy or 10% after orchiectomy alone [ 28 ]. Compared to TCS who did not receive chemotherapy, those who underwent 1 to 4 cycles and ≥5 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy had higher risks of symptomatic paresthesia of the hands (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5–2.7; OR 3.9, 95% CI 2.1–7.3, resp.) and feet (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.7–3.0; OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7–5.7, resp.) [ 28 ]. In the same study [ 28 ], radiotherapy was significantly associated with symptomatic paresthesias of the feet (OR 1.5), but retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) was not an independent risk factor. Increasing levels of residual serum platinum are also directly associated with severity of neurotoxicity after adjusting for initial cisplatin dose [ 71 ]. Sprauten et al. reported [ 71 ] that the total score for the Scale for Chemotherapy Induced Neuropathy (SCIN) had a significant four-to five-fold association with the highest residual serum platinum quartile in cisplatin-treated TC patients. Oldenburg et al. [ 72 ] investigated the impact of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of glutathione S-transferase ( GST )  P 1,  M 1, and  T 1 on self-reported paresthesia among long-term TCS. The  GSTP1-GG  genotype conferred a significantly lower risk of developing paresthesia in the fingers (OR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.22–0.96) and toes (OR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.20–0.88) than the  GSTP1-AA  and  GSTP1-AG  genotypes. Recently, a genome-wide analysis of cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in survivors of adult-onset cancer reported that genetically determined expression level of  RPRD1B  was associated with cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy [ 73 ]. Defects in  RPRD1B  expression or knockdown cause a deficiency in DNA repair mechanisms known to be critical in repairing cisplatin-induced lesions [ 74 ] and result in increased sensitivity to cisplatin in a breast cancer cell line, MDA-123 [ 75 ]. No therapeutic agents are currently recommended for the prevention of peripheral neuropathy due to the paucity of high-quality, consistent evidence. For management of drug-induced peripheral neuropathy, the ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline [ 76 ] recommends treatment with duloxetine as potentially the most effective drug. Health care providers may also offer tricyclic antidepressants (i.e., nortriptyline), gabapentin, and a compounded topical gel containing baclofen, amitriptyline HCL, and ketamine based on clinical benefits observed for other neuropathic pain conditions [ 76 ]."

        "section_name": "5. Ototoxicity",
        "content": "Cisplatin selectively damages the outer hair cells of the cochlea [ 77 ], causing tinnitus and hearing loss that predominantly affect high frequencies [ 77 – 79 ] similar to age-related presbycusis. After a median follow-up of 58 months, Bokemeyer et al. [ 78 ] found that 20% of TCS (median age: 31 years) reported symptomatic ototoxicity (59% tinnitus, 18% hearing loss, 23% both) after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. For TCS who received >400 mg/m 2  of cumulative cisplatin dose, 50% self-reported tinnitus and hearing loss compared to 20% of those treated with ≤400 mg/m 2  [ 78 ]. Older age, higher cumulative cisplatin dose, a history of noise exposure, hypertension, and impaired baseline renal function and hearing are each independently associated with more severe ototoxicity [ 78 – 80 ]. A recent comprehensive audiometric analysis of 488 North American TCS [ 79 ] reported that almost one in five (18%) had severe to profound hearing loss as defined by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria (median follow-up: 4.25 years after completion of cisplatin-based chemotherapy). Tinnitus (40% patients) was significantly correlated with reduced hearing at each frequency ( P  < 0.001). The same study [ 79 ] also found that increasing cumulative cisplatin dose was significantly related to hearing loss at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 kHz ( P  trend for each <0.05). For each 100 mg/m [ 2 ] increase in cumulative cisplatin dose, a 3.2 dB impairment in age-adjusted overall hearing threshold (4–12 kHz;  P  < 0.001) resulted. However, cisplatin dose did not affect noise-induced hearing damage (10% patients) ( P =0.59) [ 79 ]. A few reports have identified significant associations of germline genetic polymorphisms of various genes with platinum-related ototoxicity, including megalin [ 81 ],  GSTP1  [ 72 ,  82 ],  GSTM3  [ 72 ,  82 ],  COMT  [ 83 ],  TPMT  [ 83 ], and  WFS1  [ 84 ]. Both alleles of  105Val-GSTP1  protected against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in cisplatin-treated TCS, whereas  GSTM1  positivity was detrimental for hearing ability [ 82 ]. Functional polymorphisms of the glutathione  S -transferases ( GSTs ) genes likely cause differential expression of the cisplatin-detoxifying enzymes, consequently rendering TCS suspcetible to varying degrees of cisplatin-induced hearing impairment. A recent genome-wide association study [ 85 ] of 511 TC patients of European genetic ancestry reported that one SNP, rs62283056, in the first intron of  WFS1  (wolframin ER transmembrane glycoprotein) was significantly associated with cisplatin-associated ototoxicity ( P =1.4 × 10 −8 ), with higher cisplatin doses exacerbating hearing loss in TC patients with the risk allele. In the general population,  WSF1  mutations causes the Mendelian disorders DFNA6 (deafness, autosomal dominant 6) and the recessive Wolfram syndrome (with hearing loss) [ 86 ,  87 ]. There are no effective pharmacologic agents available to prevent or treat cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. TCS should use ear protection to minimize noise exposure and additional hearing loss. Since the peak concentration of cisplatin may be directly associated with the severity of ototoxicity [ 28 ,  88 ], where indicated, the 5-day BEP regimen seems preferable to a 3-day regimen [ 7 ]."

        "section_name": "6. Pulmonary Toxicity",
        "content": "The incidence of fatal bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity is approximately 1–3% [ 89 ,  90 ]. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment of bleomycin-induced pneumonitis, although there are no data from prospective randomized trials to support this approach [ 91 ]. Health care providers should withhold bleomycin at the earliest signs or symptoms of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicities during chemotherapy. Since age of more than 40 years [ 89 ] and increased tobacco use [ 92 ] are both significantly associated with pulmonary toxicity during bleomycin treatment, a careful assessment of patient history (i.e., age, smoking status, and preexisting lung disease) are important to consider prior to the administration of any bleomycin-containing regimen [ 93 ]. Avoiding perioperative overhydration is important to minimize the risk of perioperative lung complications, but perioperative oxygen restriction in patients a few months after administration of bleomycin is not necessary [ 94 ,  95 ]. Bleomycin hydrolase is an enzyme encoded by the  BLMH  gene, which inactivates bleomycin [ 96 ]. A Dutch investigation of 340 TC patients treated with bleomycin-containing chemotherapy between 1977 and 2003 reported that the genetic polymorphism of 1450A > G was not associated with bleomycin-induced pneumonitis or changes in pulmonary function tests [ 97 ]. A large Norwegian study [ 92 ] of 1049 long-term TCS treated during 1980 to 1994 (median follow-up: 11.2 years) reported that 8% of survivors had restrictive lung disease as defined by predicted FVC <80% and a value of ≥70% for forced expiratory volume (FEV) 1/forced vital capacity (FVC). In multivariate analyses adjusting for bleomycin, etoposide, and vinblastine doses, higher cumulative cisplatin dose ( P =0.007) and older age ( P =0.008) were both significantly related to restrictive lung disease [ 92 ]. Compared with men treated with surgery only, patients who received large cumulative doses of cisplatin (>850 mg) as well as combined chemotherapy and pulmonary surgery were at significantly increased risk of demonstrating decreased spirometry variables, including age-adjusted FVC, FEV1, FVC% predicted, and FEV1% predicted [ 92 ]. A population-based study of TCS reported to North American and European cancer registries found that patients treated with chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy) in 1975 or later had a 1.6-fold higher risk of mortality (95% CI 1.25–2.01) (median follow-up: 10 years) due to respiratory diseases compared to the general population. The extent to which bleomycin-induced lung toxicity may have contributed to these excesses is not known."

Two long-term studies [ 100 ,  101 ] reported persistently decreased renal function in TCS for years after completion of treatment compared with baseline assessments. A Norwegian study [ 100 ] of 85 TC patients more than 10 years after treatment showed that renal function among TCS who received radiotherapy alone decreased by 8%, whereas survivors who had cisplatin-based chemotherapy had reductions of 14%. Cumulative cisplatin dose and age at treatment were both directly associated with long-term impairment of renal function ( P  < 0.05). A Danish investigation [ 101 ] of 34 TCS who received systemic chemotherapy with PVB (median dose of cisplatin: 583 mg/m 2 ) reported that the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased by a median of 18% during treatment. At a median follow-up of 65 months (range, 43 to 97 months), 38% of survivors had persistent renal dysfunction. Research in the general population has demonstrated a relationship between decreased GFR and the presence of microalbuminuria, leading to increased risks of CVD and all-cause mortality [ 102 ,  103 ]. Among long-term TCS, treatment-related nephrotoxicity may contribute to the reported increases in incident CVD events, including hypertension and MI [ 34 ,  35 ,  47 ]. To limit the severity of acute- and long-term renal damage, health care providers should administer hydration [ 104 ] and avoid nephrotoxic drugs [ 7 ] during cisplatin-based chemotherapy."

        "content": "Orchiectomy, testicular dysgenesis syndrome, postorchiectomy chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and aging are the predominant causes of hypogonadism and premature hormonal aging in long-term TCS [ 105 ]. A Norwegian investigation [ 105 ] reported that 307 TCS treated between 1980 and 1994 had significantly increased risks of low testosterone as well as high-luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels after radiotherapy or chemotherapy at long-term follow-up. The degree of hypogonadism was directly related to the intensity of TC treatment [ 105 – 110 ]. A recent meta-analysis reported that both standard cisplatin-based chemotherapy (OR: 1.8) and infradiaphragmatic radiotherapy (OR: 1.6) significantly increased the risk of hypogonadism among TCS, as defined by total testosterone levels less than reference levels or use of testosterone replacement therapy, when compared to orchiectomy alone [ 110 ]. Hypogonadism may lead to reduced sexual functioning and well-being, fertility problems, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, loss of energy, and depression [ 111 – 117 ]. Further, hypogonadism is directly associated with the metabolic syndrome and CVD [ 29 ,  30 ,  32 ]. A recent multi-institutional cross-sectional study [ 118 ] reported that over one-third of North American TCS had hypogonadism at a median age of 38 years; in addition, hypogonadism was associated with increased CVD risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes), erectile dysfunction, and medication use for anxiety/depression ( P  < 0.05). Health care providers should regularly assess TCS for symptoms of hypogonadism and check hormonal status as clinically indicated. Clinical symptoms of hypogonadism should guide treatment decisions with testosterone replacement therapy [ 7 ]. Referral to endocrinologists for evaluation and management of difficult cases should also be considered."

Approximately 50% of patients with newly diagnosed TC have decreased sperm counts (<20 million/mL), low sperm motility indices (<40), and a high percentage of abnormal sperm cells (>80%) prior to initiation of any radiation or chemotherapy [ 119 ]. In a multicenter prospective study of 2318 TC patients in Germany and Austria [ 120 ], TC patients had significantly reduced spermatogenesis in their contralateral testicles confirmed histologically when compared to healthy subjects. The overall conception and paternity rates among long-term TCS with known intention to conceive a child after treatment completion range from 49% to 88% in several investigations (range of median follow-up: 7 to 12 years) [ 109 ,  121 – 123 ]. Radiotherapy can adversely affect reproductive function of TCS in the short-term [ 124 ,  125 ], since spermatogonia are the most sensitive germ cells to radiation treatment [ 126 ]. In the SWOG-8711 clinical trial of 207 patients with seminoma [ 124 ], sperm concentration reached a nadir 4 to 6 months after completion of radiotherapy, but returned to pretreatment level by 10 to 24 months after end of treatment. Similarly, Gandini et al. [ 127 ] reported that the sperm counts of TC patients reached a nadir at 6 months after radiation treatment, but 94% of patients recovered sperm counts by 2 years after end of radiotherapy. Higher dose of radiation is directly associated with longer recovery time for sperm concentration, and the use of testicular shielding devices significantly improves recovery of spermatogenesis [ 124 ]. A recent investigation of 1191 Norwegian TCS (median follow-up: 11 years) confirmed that radiotherapy had no significant long-term effects on sperm counts when compared to the surgery-only cohort [ 125 ]. In a retrospective study [ 128 ] of 178 TC patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy in England, 64%, 24%, and 15% of patients who were normospermic, oligospermic and azoospermic, respectively, in the prechemotherapy period recovered normal spermatogenesis at least one year after chemotherapy completion. Prechemotherapy normospermia (HR 6.0), use of carboplatin versus cisplatin (HR 4.4), and noninclusion of a vinca alkaloid (HR 5.3) in chemotherapy regimen were significantly associated with normal recovery of sperm counts [ 128 ]. Cumulative dose of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is directly associated with infertility risk [ 112 ,  123 ,  125 ,  128 ]. In a multicenter investigation [ 123 ] of 316 Norwegian TCS (median follow-up: 12 years), 100%, 83%, and 76% of survivors self-reported achieving posttreatment paternity after 2, 3, and 4 cycles of standard cisplatin-based chemotherapy, respectively ( P =0.022). However, sperm counts were not significantly related to number of cycles of chemotherapy in a limited cohort of patients for whom the results of semen analysis were available ( N  = 71) [ 123 ]. After a median follow-up of 10.6 years, another study [ 112 ] showed that TCS treated with high-dose chemotherapy (>850 mg cumulative cisplatin dose) had the lowest 15-year actuarial posttreatment paternity rate (48%) compared to 92% in the surveillance group and 60% in those treated with low-dose chemotherapy (≤850 mg cumulative cisplatin) ( P  < 0.001). Similarly, a recent investigation [ 125 ] reported that sperm counts and serum level of inhibin B were significantly lower in TCS treated with >850 mg cumulative cisplatin dose compared to those who had either surgery only or ≤850 mg cumulative cisplatin, whereas the serum FSH was significantly higher. Among patients with stage II or III nonseminomatous germ cell tumor who have had a serologic complete response but have persistent enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, RPLND is a standard treatment. To potentially avoid toxicities associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, RPLND is another treatment option for low-volume stage II nonseminomatous germ cell tumor with normal β-hCG and AFP levels after orchiectomy [ 62 ]. Injury to the retroperitoneal postganglionic sympathetic nerves during RPLND may result in retrograde ejaculation [ 126 ], leading to inability to conceive without use of cryopreserved sperm. The rate of retrograde ejaculation ranges from 1 to 9% after primary RPLND [ 129 – 131 ], 11% to 29% after nerve-sparing postchemotherapy RPLND [ 130 ,  132 – 134 ], and 75% after full bilateral postchemotherapy RPLND [ 135 ]. Health care providers should address the possibility of infertility and discuss fertility preservation options with TC patients as detailed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline for fertility preservation for patients with cancer [ 136 ]. If clinically indicated, referral to appropriate reproductive specialists should be considered [ 136 ]. Sperm cryopreservation is a standard fertility preservation practice [ 136 ] that may be offered to interested TC patients undergoing treatment."

        "content": "Avascular necrosis commonly affects the femoral head, often bilaterally [ 137 ], with an incidence of approximately 1-2% in long-term TCS treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy [ 137 ,  138 ]. The etiology for avascular necrosis is multifactorial [ 7 ] but likely to be partially attributable to corticosteroids used as antiemetics during TC treatment [ 137 – 140 ]. Bleomycin and vinblastine have also been hypothesized as causative agents in a case of avascular necrosis in one TCS who did not receive corticosteroids during chemotherapy [ 141 ]. Health care providers should review with TC patients who receive high-dose corticosteroids the potential risk of avascular necrosis. For any long-term TCS who develops early symptoms suggestive of avascular necrosis, including decreased hip motion and/or limp, prompt evaluation with plain radiograph or MRI is critical [ 7 ]."

        "content": "The underlying mechanisms of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment have not been elucidated. Several neuroimaging studies of breast cancer survivors have reported that white matter activation patterns involved in cognitive functioning are altered after chemotherapy [ 142 – 144 ], likely due to neurotoxic effects [ 145 ]. A study [ 146 ] of 66 TC patients suggested that cortisol levels prior to chemotherapy may be a predictor of later cognitive complaints. The prevalence of cognitive impairment in men with newly diagnosed TC before receipt of any chemotherapy ranges from 46% to 58% and is significantly higher than expected in the healthy normal population ( P  < 0.01) [ 146 ,  147 ]. A prospective clinical trial [ 88 ] of 666 patients with metastatic TC in Europe showed that cognitive function decreased at 3 months after chemotherapy, though not at the level of clinical relevance but recovered to baseline values at 2 years for most patients, with 19% still having worsened cognitive function at that time. However, the association of cisplatin-based chemotherapy with cognitive impairment in TCS remains unclear. Whereas three studies [ 148 – 150 ] of TCS ( N  = 70–112; median follow-up: 1–3 years) reported no significant differences in performance on cognitive tests between TC treatment groups (i.e., surgery only versus chemotherapy), two investigations [ 151 ,  152 ] reported increased risks of cognitive impairment after chemotherapy. Among 1173 TCS with a median follow-up of 9 years, Skoogh et al. [ 151 ] reported a 2-fold increased risk (95% CI 1.3–3.1) of long-term compromised speech in survivors who completed five or more cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy compared to those who received no chemotherapy. Similarly, a single institutional prospective study [ 152 ] of TC patients after orchiectomy who either received adjuvant chemotherapy ( N  = 55) or no additional treatment ( N  = 14) reported that chemotherapy was significantly associated with cognitive decline with a dose-response relationship observed at 12 months (surveillance group: 0%; 2-3 cycles of chemotherapy: 52%; and 4–7 cycles of chemotherapy: 67%). Although the extent to which cisplatin-based chemotherapy may have negative effects on long-term cognitive function in TCS is unclear, cognitive complaints among long-term survivors are common and independent of treatment modality [ 88 ,  148 – 151 ]. These subjective complaints may reflect the effects of anxiety and depression, which are prevalent in TCS [ 148 ]. The first step in managing cognitive complaints may include managing specific stressors by implementing effective coping strategies."

Young age, peripheral neuropathy, economic difficulties, excess alcohol use, sexual concerns, and prior treatment for mental illness were significantly associated with HADS-defined anxiety disorder [ 153 ]. A recent investigation [ 154 ] showed that the prevalence of clinically significant anxiety among TCS (mean: 11.6 years after diagnosis) in Germany was 6.1%. Anxiety was significantly associated with younger age at diagnosis and shorter time since diagnosis in multivariate analyses. Prior studies [ 153 – 156 ] reported that the prevalence of depression among TCS ranges from 7.9% to 20%, but the extent to which TCS may experience significantly more depressive orders compared to the general population is uncertain. Feeling helpless/hopeless [ 156 ], lower social support [ 156 ], a higher number of physical symptoms [ 154 ], and having children [ 154 ] were reported to be significantly associated with higher levels of depression."

The prevalence of chronic cancer-related fatigue among Norwegian TCS was significantly higher compared to age-matched men in the general population (17.1% versus 9.7%) [ 158 ]. A recent longitudinal investigation [ 159 ] of 812 TCS treated between 1980 and 1994 in Norway reported that the prevalence of chronic fatigue increased from 15% at survey I (1998–2002) to 27% at survey II (2007-2008) ( P  < 0.001). Several factors were significantly associated with chronic fatigue in this study: [ 159 ] high level of neuropathy, Raynaud-like phenomena, testosterone level in the lowest quartile, low level of physical activity, as well as higher levels of anxiety and depression. Health care professionals should consider exercise and psychological interventions for early prevention and treatment of chronic fatigue among TCS. A recent meta-analysis of cancer survivors [ 160 ] reported that exercise and psychological interventions are effective for reducing cancer-related fatigue during and after cancer treatment and significantly more effective than available pharmaceutical options."

        "content": "To develop risk-stratified, evidence-based follow-up recommendations for TCS, characterization of long-term adverse health outcomes (AHOs) is critical. A recent multi-institutional investigation [ 40 ] of 952 North American TCS examined the type and prevalence of AHOs after chemotherapy with four cycles of EP (EPX4) or three or four cycles of BEP (BEPX3/BEPX4) ( Table 3 ). At a median age of 37 years, more than one-third of survivors reported three or more AHOs with similar prevalence and type after EPX4 and BEPX3, except for Raynaud phenomenon (11.6% versus 21.4%;  P  < 0.01), peripheral neuropathy (29.2% versus 21.4%;  P =0.02), and obesity (25.5% versus 33.0%;  P =0.04). The type and prevalence of AHOs after BEPX4 were largely similar to EPX4 and BEPX3. Increasing age at clinical evaluation, current tobacco use, and nonmarried status were associated with increased numbers of AHOs, whereas weekly vigorous physical activity was protective ( P  < 0.05). Self-reported health was excellent/very good in approximately 60% of TCS, but this proportion decreased as number of AHOs increased ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure 2 )."

        "section_name": "15. Conclusions",
        "content": "Due to their young age at diagnosis, long-term survival, and current use of largely homogeneous therapies, TCS comprise an ideal cohort for adult-onset cancer survivorship research [ 161 ]. Moreover, these patients now comprise approximately 4% of all male cancer survivors [ 162 ].  Table 4  summarizes major research priorities for TC survivors set forth at an international consensus conference [ 161 ]. An overarching recommendation was the development of longitudinal cohort studies to evaluate the life-long burden and latency trends of medical and psychosocial morbidities by category of treatment. TC is relatively unique among cancer types in that it provides for the ready availability of a “comparison group” cured with surgery only without the confounding effects of cytotoxic treatment, with which to compare the late effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Moreover, study of the surgery-only group itself is informative and presents a unique opportunity to study the long-term history of a cancer cured without cytotoxic therapy, including any inherently preprogrammed development of adverse metabolic and other outcomes. This type of proposed cohort investigation, which gathers comprehensive exposure and outcome data, can provide the basis for identifying predictors of AHOs, either singly or jointly, for the eventual development of preventive and interventional measures. An important goal not only for TCS, but for cancer survivors in general, is the identification of genetic variants that predispose to the development of acute and long-term treatment toxicities. This elucidation of etiopathogenetic pathways provides another step towards developing targeted prevention and intervention strategies to optimize risk-based care, minimize chronic morbidities, and improve patients' quality of life."

    "abstract": "Background: Testicular cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma are prevalent malignancies among young males aged 20 to 39. The incidence of testicular cancer and lymphoma has risen in recent years, with orchiectomy often followed by adjuvant chemotherapy as the primary treatment for testicular cancer and chemotherapy for lymphoma. Chemotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy and reduced fertility. Method: This systematic review included seven studies, both case–control and longitudinal prospective designs, from the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. The screening process was conducted using the online tool covidence.org. Results: The study outcomes indicate varied impacts of chemotherapy on aneuploidy rates. An increase in the aneuploidy rates, notably for the sex chromosomes, immediately post-treatment was a common trend, followed by a decline in pretreatment values. Conclusion: This systematic review presents the effects of chemotherapy on the aneuploidy rates of testicular cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients, with a decrease post-treatment. The findings underscore the need for larger, well-designed studies with a longer study period.",

        "content": "Testicular cancer and lymphoma are the most common types of malignant tumors among young males between the ages of 20 and 39 years. Testicular cancer is classified into two types based on the cancerous cells: germ cell tumors (GCTs) and non-germ cell tumors (gonadal or sex-cord stromal tumors). Germ cell tumors, which are further divided into seminomatous and non-seminomatous, have been the most reported form of malignant tumors arising in the testes [ 1 ]. Lymphoma disease is divided into two main types: Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Hodgkin’s lymphoma is the most common form among young men [ 2 ]. The incidence of testicular cancer has been increasing in recent years, with a low mortality rate [ 3 ]. The first-line treatment for testicular cancer is often orchiectomy, with additional postsurgical treatment and adjuvant chemotherapy to prevent relapse of the disease [ 4 ]. The most common treatment form for lymphoma is chemotherapy, with a high survival rate. Although chemotherapy is an effective treatment option for lymphoma, it can have severe adverse effects on the patients due to the presence of alkylating agents. Alkylating agents can be associated with an increased risk of infertility due to decreases in the sperm concentrations of young boys and adolescents treated for cancer [ 5 ]. The human genome normally consists of 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs, with 1 chromosome in each pair inherited from each parent. Aneuploidy is defined as an abnormality in the number of chromosomes in a cell, encompassing conditions characterized by trisomy (an additional chromosome) or monosomy (a missing chromosome). Notable instances of trisomy include Down syndrome (resulting from an additional chromosome 21), Edwards syndrome (associated with an extra chromosome 18), Patau’s syndrome (stemming from an additional chromosome 13), Klinefelter syndrome (an additional X chromosome in males) [ 6 ], and Triple X syndrome (trisomy X). Conversely, an example of monosomy is evident in Turner syndrome (monosomy X) [ 7 ]. While chemotherapy can play an important role in the treatment of testicular cancer and lymphoma, it can also have unintended long- and short-term side effects on the body of the patient due to the toxicity components of the treatment, including gonadal toxicity [ 8 ]. Chemotherapy is composed of two to four cycles of the PEB (cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin) regimen. Some studies have documented the effects of PEB chemotherapy on the inhibition of spermatogenesis. However, only a few studies have documented the effects of chemotherapy on sperm aneuploidy rates. The aim of this systematic review is to describe the effects of chemotherapy on aneuploidy rates."

        "content": "The study selection process is presented in the PRISMA flowchart diagram ( Figure 1 ). We obtained 1114 articles after the initial search string on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase, with an additional 2 papers obtained through expert knowledge. Only 1 duplicated article was removed, 1115 articles were screened by title and abstract, and we excluded 1077 articles. This resulted in 38 articles that underwent full screening and 10 articles that were not included in the screening due to missing eligibility criteria. The total number of articles that were included in the following review is seven. An overview of the study characteristics is provided in  Table 1 . The longitudinal prospective studies included one Italian and two French studies [ 11 , 12 , 13 ]. The case–control studies included one French, one French/Lebanese, one American, and one Canadian study [ 8 , 14 , 15 , 16 ]. The primary outcomes of all the studies included in this review were the effects of chemotherapy on aneuploidy rates. The study period was from 1997 to 2017. In a longitudinal prospective study performed by Burrello et al. [ 12 ], they investigated the effects of antineoplastic treatment on the sperm aneuploidy rates and sperm concentrations in male offspring diagnosed with testicular cancer at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months from the treatment time. Analysis of the sperm aneuploidy rates was conducted using a double and triple multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique targeting chromosomes 8, 12, 18, X, and Y. A total of 11 males between 18 and 30 years of age with testicular cancer and 18 healthy males between 19 and 35 years of age participated. The results showed that there was a slight increase in the aneuploidy rates at 6 months after treatment, but 36 months after treatment, the results showed a significant decrease in the total aneuploidy rates (%) ((0.65)  p  = 0.005) compared to the pretreatment value ((1.01)  p  = 0.005). Another French longitudinal prospective study from 2001 [ 11 ] investigated the effects of PEB adjuvant chemotherapy on the aneuploidy rates 6 to 18 months after performing the treatment in testicular cancer patients. The FISH technique was used for chromosomes 7, 16, 18, X, and Y. The results of the study showed an increase in diploidy and disomy for chromosomes 16, 18, and XY after chemotherapy, in comparison to the control group ( Table 2  and  Table 3 ). In a case–control study performed in Canada [ 14 ], human sperm chromosome complements were observed in four testicular cancer patients before and 2 to 13 years after receiving bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy treatment. The main outcome was no notable disparity in the total frequency of sperm chromosomal abnormalities, with 10.2% before chemotherapy and 10.7% after chemotherapy. The results for the frequency of numerical abnormalities were similar, with 2.5% before chemotherapy and 2.4% after chemotherapy. In a French case–control study [ 16 ], the frequency of sperm aneuploidy in Hodgkin’s disease patients was investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Chromosomes 1, 6, 11, X, and Y were studied, and results were obtained both before and after administering chemotherapy. Overall, all chromosomes had an increase in the aneuploidy rate both before and after chemotherapy. At day 0, the frequencies of 24 and XX and 24 and XY (1.64% and 8.46%, respectively) were higher than in the control group. Hyperhaploid 24, YY, and disomy 1 also presented higher values. The post-treatment aneuploidy rate after 38 days showed an increase in all chromosomes studied, with 24 and XX and 24 and XY standing out with rates more than three times higher compared to the control group. In a French prospective longitudinal study, Martinez et al. [ 13 ] investigated the effects of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ADVP) chemotherapy (±radiotherapy) and doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP)/mechlorethamine, oncovin, procarbazine, prednisone–doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (MOPP-ABV) (±radiotherapy) on aneuploidy rates and sperm production in Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients. The FISH method was used before and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after administering antineoplastic treatment. Before treatment (month 0), the aneuploidy rates were higher in Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients in comparison to the control group, especially hyperhaploid XY ( p  = 0.008) and disomy 18 (0.10). Furthermore, the aneuploidy rates continued to increase after 3 months, significantly for haploid 24 and XY. Lower levels were found after 12 and 24 months post-treatment. In an American case–control study [ 15 ], differences in the aneuploidy rates before and after chemotherapy in patients with testicular cancer or Hodgkin’s lymphoma were observed. Increases in the aneuploidy rates for chromosomes 13 and 21 were observed for testicular cancer patients, with a significant increase in chromosome 21 (0.19%) before chemotherapy in comparison to its value at 12 (0.09%) and 18–24 months (0.08%). Also, increases in disomy 13 were observed at 18–24 months post-CT (0.22) compared to pre-CT and at 6 months post-CT (0.11 and 0.06). With Hodgkin’s lymphoma, nullisomy 13 increased in 6 months (0.37) and 12 months (0.30). A decline to 0.27 was found after 18–24 months, reaching a level close to the pretreatment value (0.24). For nullisomy 21, an increase in aneuploidy was also observed, with a pretreatment value of 0.17% compared to the post-treatment value at 6 months (0.25%). A declined aneuploidy rate was observed after 12 months (0.15%). For the sex chromosomes, the frequency of XY disomy was higher 6 months after treatment for both testicular cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients (0.21% and 0.28%, respectively) compared to the healthy male control group (0.13). In the French–Lebanese case–control study [ 8 ], the aneuploidy rates were analyzed using FISH after neoplastic treatment in testicular cancer patients and lymphoma patients. No increases in the aneuploidy rates of 12 lymphoma patients were obtained except in one patient for disomies 13, 13, and 21 (0.79%), disomies X, Y, and 18 (1.45%) and in diploidy (1.38). Aside from four testicular cancer patients, no overall significant increase in the disomies of chromosomes 13, 21, 18, X, Y, or diploidy was observed. Evaluation of the study evidence was carried out using the risk-of-bias tool by the CLARITY group at McMaster University for the retrospective longitudinal studies and the CASP checklist for the case–control studies ( Table 4 ). All studies except one [ 15 ] had small sample sizes, thus not representing the general population. Due to the small, simple sizes, there is an increased possibility of selection bias. The lack of consistent reporting standards across studies also hinders a comprehensive risk-of-bias assessment. Some studies also lacked clarity in their methodological descriptions, particularly regarding how they controlled for confounding variables. In conclusion, the tools to assess the risk of bias highlighted the potential for information bias and issues with the measurement of outcomes."

        "content": "In a longitudinal prospective study performed by Burrello et al. [ 12 ], they investigated the effects of antineoplastic treatment on the sperm aneuploidy rates and sperm concentrations in male offspring diagnosed with testicular cancer at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months from the treatment time. Analysis of the sperm aneuploidy rates was conducted using a double and triple multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique targeting chromosomes 8, 12, 18, X, and Y. A total of 11 males between 18 and 30 years of age with testicular cancer and 18 healthy males between 19 and 35 years of age participated. The results showed that there was a slight increase in the aneuploidy rates at 6 months after treatment, but 36 months after treatment, the results showed a significant decrease in the total aneuploidy rates (%) ((0.65)  p  = 0.005) compared to the pretreatment value ((1.01)  p  = 0.005). Another French longitudinal prospective study from 2001 [ 11 ] investigated the effects of PEB adjuvant chemotherapy on the aneuploidy rates 6 to 18 months after performing the treatment in testicular cancer patients. The FISH technique was used for chromosomes 7, 16, 18, X, and Y. The results of the study showed an increase in diploidy and disomy for chromosomes 16, 18, and XY after chemotherapy, in comparison to the control group ( Table 2  and  Table 3 ). In a case–control study performed in Canada [ 14 ], human sperm chromosome complements were observed in four testicular cancer patients before and 2 to 13 years after receiving bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy treatment. The main outcome was no notable disparity in the total frequency of sperm chromosomal abnormalities, with 10.2% before chemotherapy and 10.7% after chemotherapy. The results for the frequency of numerical abnormalities were similar, with 2.5% before chemotherapy and 2.4% after chemotherapy. In a French case–control study [ 16 ], the frequency of sperm aneuploidy in Hodgkin’s disease patients was investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Chromosomes 1, 6, 11, X, and Y were studied, and results were obtained both before and after administering chemotherapy. Overall, all chromosomes had an increase in the aneuploidy rate both before and after chemotherapy. At day 0, the frequencies of 24 and XX and 24 and XY (1.64% and 8.46%, respectively) were higher than in the control group. Hyperhaploid 24, YY, and disomy 1 also presented higher values. The post-treatment aneuploidy rate after 38 days showed an increase in all chromosomes studied, with 24 and XX and 24 and XY standing out with rates more than three times higher compared to the control group. In a French prospective longitudinal study, Martinez et al. [ 13 ] investigated the effects of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ADVP) chemotherapy (±radiotherapy) and doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP)/mechlorethamine, oncovin, procarbazine, prednisone–doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (MOPP-ABV) (±radiotherapy) on aneuploidy rates and sperm production in Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients. The FISH method was used before and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after administering antineoplastic treatment. Before treatment (month 0), the aneuploidy rates were higher in Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients in comparison to the control group, especially hyperhaploid XY ( p  = 0.008) and disomy 18 (0.10). Furthermore, the aneuploidy rates continued to increase after 3 months, significantly for haploid 24 and XY. Lower levels were found after 12 and 24 months post-treatment. In an American case–control study [ 15 ], differences in the aneuploidy rates before and after chemotherapy in patients with testicular cancer or Hodgkin’s lymphoma were observed. Increases in the aneuploidy rates for chromosomes 13 and 21 were observed for testicular cancer patients, with a significant increase in chromosome 21 (0.19%) before chemotherapy in comparison to its value at 12 (0.09%) and 18–24 months (0.08%). Also, increases in disomy 13 were observed at 18–24 months post-CT (0.22) compared to pre-CT and at 6 months post-CT (0.11 and 0.06). With Hodgkin’s lymphoma, nullisomy 13 increased in 6 months (0.37) and 12 months (0.30). A decline to 0.27 was found after 18–24 months, reaching a level close to the pretreatment value (0.24). For nullisomy 21, an increase in aneuploidy was also observed, with a pretreatment value of 0.17% compared to the post-treatment value at 6 months (0.25%). A declined aneuploidy rate was observed after 12 months (0.15%). For the sex chromosomes, the frequency of XY disomy was higher 6 months after treatment for both testicular cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients (0.21% and 0.28%, respectively) compared to the healthy male control group (0.13). In the French–Lebanese case–control study [ 8 ], the aneuploidy rates were analyzed using FISH after neoplastic treatment in testicular cancer patients and lymphoma patients. No increases in the aneuploidy rates of 12 lymphoma patients were obtained except in one patient for disomies 13, 13, and 21 (0.79%), disomies X, Y, and 18 (1.45%) and in diploidy (1.38). Aside from four testicular cancer patients, no overall significant increase in the disomies of chromosomes 13, 21, 18, X, Y, or diploidy was observed."

        "section_name": "4. Discussion",
        "content": "This systematic review included seven case–control and longitudinal prospective studies, with an aim to describe the effects of chemotherapy on aneuploidy rates before and after treatment in patients diagnosed with testicular cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The quality of the study evidence among the included studies was low, primarily due to their limited sample populations. Among the studies focusing on testicular cancer patients, some reported negligible or small correlations between chemotherapy and increased aneuploidy rates [ 8 , 13 ]. In contrast, other studies demonstrated a significant association between chemotherapy and increased aneuploidy rates [ 11 , 12 , 15 ]. Notably, Burrello et al. [ 12 ] observed higher pretreatment aneuploidy rates compared to the controls. The observed trend across the studies indicates a transient increase in aneuploidy rates shortly after chemotherapy, followed by a subsequent decline toward pretreatment values ( Table 4 ). All chromosomes analyzed exhibited susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced alterations, with sex chromosomes, particularly disomy XY, appearing to be the most affected, as described by Tempest et al. [ 15 ], Burrello et al. [ 12 ], and De mas et al. [ 11 ]. Four articles studied the effects of chemotherapy on Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients [ 8 , 13 , 15 , 16 ]. One of the four studies, a case–control study [ 16 ], showed a correlation between chemotherapy and increased aneuploidy rates in the numerical chromosomes and sex chromosomes. These results were corroborated by Tempest et al. [ 15 ], who reported an elevated frequency of aneuploidy for autosomal chromosomes (13, 21) and sex chromosomes (disomy XY) in sperm. Additionally, both Tempest et al. [ 15 ] and Martinez et al. [ 13 ] reported higher pretreatment values for aneuploidy frequency. However, Thomas et al. [ 8 ] did not observe increased aneuploidy rates among Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients, with only 1 out of 14 patients exhibiting elevated rates. Out of the seven studies included in this review, four longitudinal prospective studies were strengthened. One of them included a large prospective study of high quality [ 13 ]. Additionally, one of the case–control studies used a blind analysis to obtain their results [ 14 ]. The other studies could have had an increased risk of selection bias due to the limitations of their study populations. The lack of consistent reporting standards across the studies also hindered a comprehensive risk-of-bias assessment. Some strengths of this study include the careful search in three databases and the process following the recommendations set by the PRISMA guideline. To our knowledge, this review, therefore, contains the highest number of studies in this field to date. This study included patients who received all kinds of chemotherapy and had different aneuploidies, including all chromosomes. A limitation of our review is that many of the published studies are small and of poor quality, leading to low statistical power and an increased risk of type II errors. Not all studies included semen samples obtained before treatment, and therefore, it was difficult to distinguish between the effects of the disease and the effects of the antineoplastic treatment. Furthermore, it could also be considered if other confounders should have been included in the studies. Increased evidence about sperm aneuploidy after chemotherapy may advance the field of andrology. When sufficient knowledge is obtained, the counseling of patients according to their sperm aneuploidy rates is highly relevant before administering chemotherapy. Future studies should aim for larger sample populations to improve the reliability and applicability of the results. Standardized reporting guidelines should be adopted in future research to enhance transparency and reproducibility with larger samples and by ensuring comprehensive documentation of their methods, including detailed descriptions of how confounders are managed."

        "section_name": "5. Conclusions",
        "content": "In conclusion, most of the studies showed correlations between antineoplastic treatment and increased aneuploidy rates. Importantly, in some studies, an increased aneuploidy frequency was observed prior to antineoplastic treatment for both testicular cancer patients and Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients. These patients also showed increases in their aneuploidy rates shortly after treatment. The evidence suggests that chemotherapy is an important factor that influences the rise in aneuploidy rates more than cancer itself, with a notable increase immediately after the end of treatment, followed by a decline toward pretreatment values within 38 days to over 1 year. While all chromosomes were affected in different proportions, the sex chromosomes demonstrated heightened susceptibility. While each study in this review provides valuable insights, it is important for larger, well-designed studies with extended follow-up to inform clinical practice and guide interventions to prevent male infertility in patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment for both testicular cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. A comparison of different alkylating and non-alkylating agents is absolutely needed."

    "title": "Feasibility of a physical activity intervention during and shortly after chemotherapy for testicular cancer",
    "abstract": "Background Given the risk of developing acute and long-term adverse effects in patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy for testicular cancer (TC), risk-reducing interventions, such as physical activity (PA), may be relevant. Limited knowledge is available on the challenges met when conducting PA intervention trials in patients with TC during and shortly after chemotherapy. The aims of the present feasibility study are therefore to determine patient recruitment, compliance and adherence to a PA intervention. Results Patients with metastatic TC referred to cisplatin-based chemotherapy were eligible. They followed an individual low-threshold PA intervention, including counseling from a personal coach during and 3 months after chemotherapy. Outcomes were recruitment rate, compliance rate and adherence to the intervention including preferences for type of PA and barriers for PA. During 8 months 12 of 18 eligible patients were invited, all consented, but three dropped out. Walking and low intensity activities were preferred and nausea and feeling unwell were the most often reported barriers towards PA. Discussion In order to achieve adequate recruitment, compliance and complete data in future PA intervention trials, close cooperation with treating physicians, individual PA plans and availability of personalized coaching are required.

        "section_name": "Background",
        "content": "Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common cancer among men between 18–40 years of age [ 1 ]. Standard treatment for patients with low- or intermediate risk metastatic disease is chemotherapy including three or four cycles with etoposide and cisplatin with or without bleomycin (EP or BEP) [ 2 ]. This treatment often leads to acute toxic effects such as bone marrow suppression, nausea, thromboembolic events, reduced kidney function, and peripheral neuropathy, resulting in reduced well-being and physical capacity during treatment [ 3 ]. After chemotherapy, long-term TC survivors are at risk of several late effects and display a higher risk of diabetes and myocardial infarction compared to age-matched men from the general population [ 4 ,  5 ]. Interventions that can reduce the risk of acute and long-term adverse effects are therefore warranted. Several meta-analyses have concluded that physical exercise is a feasible and beneficial intervention for several health outcomes in cancer patients, however most studies have been conducted in breast cancer patients and after cancer treatment [ 6 – 9 ]. In a recent review, only 17 studies were identified assessing the effects of physical exercise during adjuvant cancer treatment, of which 14 studies included breast cancer patients, two studies lung cancer patients and one study patients with several diagnoses [ 10 ]. Studies examining the feasibility and effects of physical activity (PA) during chemotherapy treatment in patients with other diagnoses than breast cancer, such as cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic TC are needed [ 11 ]. One rationale for initiating PA during chemotherapy is to maintain physical fitness, both in terms of aerobic capacity and muscle strength, and thereby possibly reduce troublesome side-effects and increase well-being. On the other side acute side-effects might be barriers towards PA, and more knowledge on the optimal content of a PA intervention during such treatment and how these interventions should be conducted in practice is needed. Before planning and implementing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) including PA in patients with metastatic TC during chemotherapy, patient recruitment, compliance and patients’ adherence to such intervention are important to ensure that a RCT can be successfully performed. A review by Oldervoll et al. [ 12 ] focused on recruitment, compliance and adherence to PA interventions during and after cancer treatment. In 12 RCTs, the average recruitment rate was 43%, the average compliance rate was 86% and the adherence to the interventions ranged from 72–100%. The majority of the participants (62%) were breast cancer patients during and after chemotherapy [ 12 ]. The young age, male gender and the BEP/EP regimen, with its specific toxic effects, might interfere differently on the feasibility in PA studies in patients with metastatic TC than other cancer populations. Therefore, the aims of the present feasibility study are to determine patient recruitment, compliance and adherence to a PA intervention during and shortly after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic TC."

        "content": "This feasibility study was performed as a single institutional prospective one-armed intervention study at Oslo University Hospital (OUH) from December 2012 to July 2013 (8 months). OUH is the only institution treating patients with newly diagnosed TC within a population of approximately 2.8 million individuals, living in the south eastern part of Norway. Most patients undergo orchiectomy at their local hospital, but are thereafter referred to OUH for staging and eventually further treatment. Risk-adapted treatment of patients with metastatic TC comprises three or four cycles of BEP or four EP [ 2 ]. Each cycle of 21 days includes 5 days at OUH receiving chemotherapy infusions (days 1–5), and 16 days at home (days 6–21). At day 15, the patients receive bleomycin intravenously at their local hospital. Post-chemotherapy residual tumor often requires surgery, most frequently retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Patients eligible for the present study fulfilled the following criteria: newly diagnosed metastatic TC, planned for three or four cycles with BEP/EP, without physical and psychological co-morbidities contraindicating the assessments and/or intervention as assessed by the responsible oncologist, age ≥18 years and no prior cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer). Due to lack of literature regarding PA in patients with metastatic TC, we conducted upfront semi-structured interviews among 11 men who previously had received BEP/EP chemotherapy for TC. These interviews revealed reduced wellbeing, fatigue and weakness especially on the days 4–7 in each cycle. Wellbeing gradually decreased throughout the treatment period. After completion of chemotherapy, the interviewed patients reported that recovery to pre-treatment physical capacity could take several months. Most interviewed patients expressed skepticism towards performing high intensity (HI) physical exercise during chemotherapy and preferred PAs with low intensity (LI) or moderate intensity (MI). On this background the intervention in the present feasibility study was designed as an individual low-threshold PA intervention during (Phase I) and shortly after (Phase II) chemotherapy (Fig.  1 ). The intervention aimed to avoid inactivity and maintenance of physical capacity. All patients got a personal coach to motivate, counsel and encourage them to follow the public health PA guidelines (≥150 min MI activity per week or ≥75 min HI activity) [ 13 ]. During the first week of treatment an individualized PA plan was developed. The patient could choose different types of PAs and the intensity should be adapted to the patient’s day-to-day wellbeing. The coach contacted the patient in person at least once during each hospitalization, and if desirable, counseled the patient during PA sessions at the training centre at the hospital. Between the hospitalizations the coach phoned the patient at least once per week, but no face-to-face counseled PA sessions were performed outside the hospital. Fig. 1 Design of the feasibility study and timeline for each patient Design of the feasibility study and timeline for each patient Phase II started after the last BEP/EP cycle and lasted for 12 weeks. The coach and the patient worked out an individual PA plan depending on the patient’s preferences. All PAs were to be performed near by the patients’ home. The coach phoned the patient every second week, encouraging him to increase the frequency, duration and intensity of PAs, at least to a level corresponding to the public health PA guidelines. Eligible patients were recruited by the responsible oncologists 1–2 weeks before the first BEP/EP cycle (Fig.  1 ). After short oral information by the treating oncologist, the patients received written information and more detailed oral information from the study coordinator if they expressed an interest in participating. The  recruitment rate  was defined as the proportion of invited patients among eligible patients. Reasons for eligible patients not being invited were identified retrospectively.  Refusal rate  was defined as the proportion of patients among the invited that did not consent to participate.  Completion rate  was defined as the proportion of consenting patients who completed any measurement at the final assessment. The patients were evaluated during the week before the first BEP/EP cycle (T0), the week after the last BEP/EP cycle (after phase I) (T1) and 12 weeks after the last BEP/EP cycle (after Phase II) (T2) (Fig.  1 ). The assessments included fasting blood sampling, questionnaires, a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and muscle strength tests.  Assessment completion rate  was defined as the proportion of completed assessments, at T0, T1 and T2 separately and summed up. The patients were asked to report all types of PA including the intensity and duration in a PA log during each chemotherapy cycle. Intensity was reported according to the Borg scale [ 14 ]. PAs rated below 12 at the Borg scale were categorized as LI sessions, activities rated from 12 to 14 were categorized as MI sessions, and activities above 14 as HI sessions [ 14 ]. At T2 the patients went through a semi-structured interview, including questions related to PA preferences (Table  4 ) and barriers asking; “On a scale from 0 to10, how did the listed adverse effects (Table  5 ) hamper your level of PA during chemotherapy?” (1 = not all to 10 = to a very high degree). The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, South-East Region (2011/2008/REK South-East A) and registered in ClinicalTrial.gov ( NCT01749774 ). Eligible patients willing to participate signed an informed consent form prior to testing at T0."

        "content": "The present feasibility study illustrates several factors that need to be considered before conducting PA intervention trials in patients with metastatic TC; possible loss of eligible patients, logistic challenges related to assessments and need for face-to-face PA counseling to increase the adherence to the intervention. On the other hand, the interest to participate in PA intervention studies seems to be high among these patients during and shortly after chemotherapy. Among all the patients referred to three or four BEP/EP during the study period, more than one fourth (7 of 25) was excluded. Four of seven patients (57%) were ineligible due to their need for immediate treatment. In future PA intervention trials this type of ineligibility should be taken into account when estimating the number of patients to be available. Even in large cancer centres the number of patients refereed to chemotherapy for metastatic TC is relatively low, and performing multi-centre studies in future trials will reduce the recruitment period. Optimal patient recruitment also requires a well established cooperation between the involved researchers and clinicians. Our feasibility study was lead by researchers within the field of PA, and highly involved clinicians are also necessary to increase the recruitment rate in future PA intervention trials. Two patients withdrew during follow-up due to studies at universities in other parts of the country, and this is probably a more common reason for drop-out in a young cancer population than in older patients. To examine the effects of PA interventions, comprehensive and long-lasting pre-post intervention assessments involving staff from several labs are often required. The interval from detection of the metastasis to initiation of chemotherapy is only a few days. A challenge is therefore to coordinate the assessments at the labs within the same day, preferable within half a day. Close cooperation between the researchers and the labs is required. Warning the test-leaders and allocating time for testing, with the risk that it might be cancelled at last minute might be necessary. A possible solution might be to start the first BEP/EP cycle on Monday afternoon giving the time before lunch for testing. In a hectic daily hospital life adjustments related to such a study might claim extra work for the doctors and nurses and their goodwill and cooperation is needed. The number of necessary assessments before and during the study should carefully be considered in future intervention trials. All patients invited to participate in the study agreed. In the study of Christensen et al. [ 16 ] 73% eligible patients were willing to participate and included. The reasons for refusal were lack of time or interest or long traveling distance. The flexible and individually adjusted intervention in our feasibility study might have favored a positive attitude towards participation and been an important reason for no drop-outs during chemotherapy. On the other hand the flexible individualized approach and lack of standardized training dose for each patients, limit the possibility to conclude on the exact dose of PA that are feasible and necessary to maintain physical capacity in future intervention trials. Standardized supervised exercise sessions at the hospital might increase the effects of a PA intervention, but the inconvenience with traveling to the hospital several times per week might be a threat to the overall adherence to the intervention and external validity. To avoid a high refusal rate in future PA intervention trials in patients with TC, we suggest that the intervention, when the patients are not hospitalized, should be conducted at fitness centres near the patients’ homes under supervision of qualified personal trainers or physiotherapists. PA near by the patients’ home might be of special importance in rural areas, and makes it easier to continue the program after the intervention period. It has been shown that patients with lung cancer performing PA after surgery had positive effects on cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and quality of life of a supervised aerobic and strength training program, supported by a personal trainer at a fitness centre near the patients’ home [ 17 ]. In the present feasibility study, the intervention was individualised and flexible according to the patient’s daily well-being, with regular counselling by the coach. Nevertheless, the level of PA during chemotherapy was lower than expected and only a few patients met the PA guidelines. Treatment related adverse effects have shown to account for more than 50% of the barriers to perform PA in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy [ 18 ]. The patients in our study reported well-known chemotherapy-related acute adverse effects as barriers to perform PA. Interestingly, after the intervention, more than half of the patients indicated that they could have been able to be more active than they actually were, and that they could have been pushed more by the coach. Christensen et al. showed that patients with TC in average performed 70% of the planned resistance training sessions during BEP supervised by a trainer. In further intervention trials more frequent face-to-face counseling by a personal trainer during the exercise sessions might be necessary to increase the PA level during BEP/EP."

        "content": "Several aspects should be addressed before planning and implementing PA intervention trials in patients with metastatic TC during chemotherapy. A close cooperation between researchers, the clinicians’ and staff at the labs is important in order to increase the recruitment- and assessment compliance rate. The experiences from this feasibility study suggest that the interest for PA during chemotherapy in patients with metastatic TC is high, but face-to-face counselling by a personal trainer or physiotherapist might be important to increase the level of PA during chemotherapy. The challenges regarding logistics related to inclusion and assessments procedures should seriously be taken into account when planning and performing PA intervention trial in patients with metastatic TC."

    "abstract": "A 25-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of right scrotal pain and upper abdominal pain. A computed tomographic scan indicated a right scrotal mass, a huge liver mass, and multiple lung masses, although there was no enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node swelling. Laboratory tests showed severe liver and kidney dysfunction and high levels of serum α-fetoprotein (11 997 ng/ml). Although needle biopsies of the testicular and liver masses were performed, the tissues were insufficient for a pathological diagnosis. As liver and kidney function worsened, we started chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP chemotherapy), which was modified because of the liver and renal dysfunction. We also used continuous hemodiafiltration and rasburicase to prevent tumor lysis syndrome. After induction of chemotherapy, the liver and kidney dysfunction improved immediately and the high orchiectomy was performed on day 8 after chemotherapy. The pathological diagnosis was a yolk sac tumor. He underwent four courses of the BEP regimen and five courses of the TIN regimen (paclitaxel, ifosphamide, and nedaplatin), followed by the resection of liver metastases. There was no evidence of viable cells in the resected liver and no recurrence was evident at 1 year postoperatively.",

        "content": "One of the standard chemotherapies for advanced testicular cancer is BEP chemotherapy (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin)  1 . In cases of liver and renal dysfunction, the doses of chemotherapeutic agents must be modified with respect to the degree of the organ dysfunction. However, most dose adjustments are empiric and the risk of undertreating the disease remains a concern. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is characterized by a group of metabolic derangements caused by the massive and abrupt release of cellular components into the blood after the rapid lysis of malignant cells  2 . TLS can be caused by solid tumors with high proliferative rates and rapid response to therapy or bulky disease (>10 cm)  3 . In some cases, TLS can lead to acute renal failure and even death. The best management for TLS is prevention  3 . Here, we report on a patient with advanced testicular cancer presenting with severe liver and kidney dysfunction who was treated successfully with modified chemotherapy combined with continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) and rasburicase."

        "content": "A 25-year-old man noticed right scrotal pain in September 2013 and visited a nearby hospital in November 2013 because of worsening scrotal pain in addition to upper abdominal pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan indicated multiple lung masses up to 9 mm, multiple liver masses up to 260 mm with portal vein thrombosis, and an 84 mm right testicular mass (Fig.  1 ). As liver and kidney function and the patient’s general condition worsened, he was referred to our hospital for further examinations and treatments. A blood examination showed severe liver and kidney dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase 1168 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase 1072 IU/l, total bilirubin 2.7 ng/ml, creatinine 2.50 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen 51 mg/dl, and uric acid 13.9 ng/ml), and marked elevation of serum testicular tumor markers [α-fetoprotein (AFP) 11 997 ng/ml and lactate dehydrase 4296 IU/l]. These results indicated advanced testicular cancer with multiple liver and lung metastases. However, advanced testicular cancer without retroperitoneal lymph node metastases is rare and the CT scan suggested a possibility of liver sarcoma. Although CT-guided needle biopsies of the testicular and hepatic masses were obtained, these tissues were insufficient for definitive pathological diagnosis. To deal with the patient’s worsening condition, we started to treat the patient assuming that he had metastatic testicular cancer without a pathological diagnosis. (a) Pulmonary CT showed multiple pulmonary metastases. Abdominal CT showed (b) multiple large liver metastases, (c) thrombosis in a portal vein, and (d) a right testicular tumor. CT, computed tomography. The chemotherapy regimen with BEP chemotherapy was modified as follows because of severe liver and kidney dysfunction: bleomycin (25 mg/body), etoposide (50 mg/m 2 ), and nedaplatin (20 mg/m 2 ) on day 1. In addition to the modified chemotherapy, CHDF, and rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, were combined to prevent TLS. As liver and kidney function improved quickly after the administration of chemotherapy, nedaplatin was replaced by cisplatin (16 mg/m 2 , 80% dose) on day 2. The cisplatin dose was increased from 16 to 20 mg/m 2  on days 4 and 5, and CHDF was discontinued on day 6 as the serum creatinine level recovered to the normal range (Fig.  2 ). Right high orchiectomy was performed on day 8 and the histopathological diagnosis was yolk sac tumor (Fig.  3 ). He was diagnosed with testicular nonseminoma with liver and lung metastases (pT2N0M1b, stage IIIC), which carries a poor prognosis on the basis of the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative group classification. After one course of the modified chemotherapy, the liver and kidney function recovered to a normal range. Three courses of full dose BEP chemotherapy were administered. As the serum AFP level was not normalized after four courses of chemotherapy, the TIN regimen (paclitaxel, ifosphamide, and nedaplatin) was administered as a salvage chemotherapy  4 . After five courses of TIN chemotherapy, the serum AFP level was normalized, and CT scan indicated a complete response of lung metastasis and a partial response of liver metastasis. Left hepatic lobectomy was performed and there was no histopathological evidence of viable cancer cells in the resected specimen. CT scan and blood test showed no signs of recurrence 1 year after left hepatic lobectomy The clinical course after admission.

        "content": "BEP chemotherapy has been established as the standard of care for germ cell tumors, with marked improvements in patient survival  1 . In treating germ cell tumors with BEP chemotherapy, the lower total dose and dose intensity of bleomycin and the lower dose intensity of etoposide may be responsible for poor outcomes  5 . However, in our case, because of multiple large liver metastases, the patient presented with severe liver dysfunction and, in addition, kidney dysfunction. Therefore, we needed to modify the chemotherapy regimen. As etoposide is metabolized into inactive forms in the liver  6 , dose reduction by 50% in patients with bilirubin between 1.5 and 3 mg/dl is recommended  6 , 7 . On the basis of these reports, we reduced etoposide by 50% for the first cycle of chemotherapy. As 60% of bleomycin is cleared by the kidney  6 , the dose of bleomycin was reduced to 25 mg/body instead of 30 mg/body. As one of the major side effects of cisplatin is renal toxicity, the administration of cisplatin requires dose adjustments in patients with renal dysfunction and cisplatin is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance below 60 ml/min  8 . Nedaplatin is a second-generation platinum derivative with reduced nephrotoxicity that exerts antitumor activity against various cancers, including testicular, gynecological, and lung carcinomas  4 , 9 – 11 . We substituted nedaplatin for cisplatin to reduce nephrotoxicity at the time of chemotherapy induction. As liver and kidney dysfunction was improved immediately after induction of the chemotherapy, a full dose of standard BEP chemotherapy was administered from the second cycle of the chemotherapy. We speculate that there could be two reasons for kidney dysfunction in this patient. First, the patient’s huge liver metastasis and portal vein thrombosis is similar to the situation of hepatorenal syndrome in patients with chronic previous liver disease. The occurrence of this syndrome is related to the mechanisms associated with ascites development, involving vasoconstriction, low renal perfusion, water and sodium retention, increased plasma volume, and consequent overflow at the splanchnic level  12 . Second, TLS may also occur before chemotherapy  3 , and the patient actually presented with hyperuricemia, hyperpotassemia, and kidney dysfunction before chemotherapy, fulfilling diagnostic criteria for TLS  3 . TLS is an oncological emergency that may occur during chemotherapy for highly chemosensitive malignancies  13 . The release of intracellular substances accompanying extensive tumor cell death is considered to be the cause of this syndrome. The production and excretion of a high volume of uric acid causes the deposition of uric acid crystals in the collecting ducts, which results in the development of uric acid nephropathy  14 . In our case, the patient’s uric acid level was very high (13.9 mg/dl) before starting chemotherapy. Thus, it is possible the patient’s renal failure is because of TLS. The treatment of TLS involves adequate hydration and administration of allopurinol or rasburicase. Before 2002, antihyperuricemic drug therapy was limited to allopurinol. As allopurinol acts by decreasing the formation of uric acid, it is ineffective in reducing levels of uric acid developed before treatment  3 . Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, which converts uric acid into the more soluble allantoin, was approved for children in 2002 and adults in 2009  15 . Rasburicase is now a standard of care for patients at high risk of TLS  15 . We administered rasburicase at the time of chemotherapy induction, and serum uric acid rapidly decreased to 0.1 mg/dl at 24 h after administration. We also used CHDF to prevent the progression of renal failure and TLS. Compared with intermittent hemodiafiltration, the major advantage of CHDF is its reduced rate of fluid removal. CHDF is generally better tolerated than conventional intermittent therapy  16 . As the general condition of the patient worsened, CHDF was administered at the intensive care unit. To avoid drug clearance by dialysis causing a loss of efficacy, CHDF was stopped during an intravenous infusion of chemotherapy drugs. Thus, the patient with advanced testicular cancer with life-threatening balky liver metastases that led to liver and kidney dysfunction was managed successfully with modified chemotherapy combined with CHDF and rasburicase. TLS is observed most frequently in patients with hematologic malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia after the initiation of cytotoxic therapy, although it may also occur spontaneously and/or in other tumor types with a high proliferative rate, large tumor burden, or high sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy  3 . TLS in patients with testicular cancer is rare, but can be life-threatening  14 , 17 . Testicular cancer is a chemotherapy-sensitive cancer that is a risk factor for the development of TLS. Attention must be paid to the potential risk of TLS in patients of advanced testicular cancer with balky metastasis."

    "abstract": "Abstract We evaluated for the first time, to our knowledge, adverse health outcomes (AHOs) among US testicular cancer survivors (TCS) given chemotherapy (n = 381) vs surgery-only patients (n = 98) managed at a single institution, accounting for non-treatment-related risk factors to delineate chemotherapy’s impact. Chemotherapy consisted largely of bleomycin-etoposide-cisplatin (BEP) administered in three or four cycles (BEPx3, n = 235; BEPx4, n = 82). Incidence of at least 3 AHOs was lowest in surgery-only TCS and increased with BEPx3, BEPx4, and other cisplatin-based regimens (12.2%, 40.8%, 52.5%, 54.8%;  P <  .0001). Multivariable modeling assessed associations of risk factors and treatment with hearing impairment, tinnitus, peripheral neuropathy, and Raynaud phenomenon. Risk for each AHO statistically increased with both increasing chemotherapy burden ( P  < .0001) and selected modifiable risk factors ( P  < .05): hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 2.40) and noise exposure (OR ≥ 2.3) for hearing impairment; noise exposure for tinnitus (OR ≥ 1.69); peripheral vascular disease for neuropathy (OR = 8.72); and current smoking for Raynaud phenomenon (OR = 2.41). Clinicians should manage modifiable risk factors for AHOs among TCS.",

    "title": "Major complications of post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in a contemporary cohort of patients with testicular cancer and a review of the literature",
    "abstract": "Background Post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (pc-RPLND) is one cornerstone in the clinical management of patients with nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumours (GCT). A wide range of complication rates in this type of surgery is reported so far. We retrospectively evaluated the frequency of major complications by using the Clavien-Dindo classification and analysed the influence of various clinical factors on complication rates in pc-RPLND. Methods We retrospectively analysed 146 GCT patients undergoing pc-RPLND. Complications of grade III–V according to the Clavien-Dindo classification occurring within 30 days after surgery were registered along with the following clinical factors: age, body mass index (BMI), duration of surgery, number of anatomic fields resected, side of primary tumour, histology of surgical specimen, histology of primary tumour, and total dose of cisplatin applied prior to surgery. For comparison, we also evaluated 35 chemotherapy-naïve patients with primary RPLND and 19 with laparoscopic RPLND. We analysed types and frequencies of the various complications as well as associations with clinical factors using descriptive statistical methods. Results A total of 14.4% grade III–IV complications were observed in pc-RPLND, and 8.6% and 5.3% in primary and in laparoscopic RPLND, respectively. There was no perioperative mortality. Lymphocele was the most frequent adverse event (16% of grade III–IV complications). Operation time > 270 min ( p  = 0.001) and vital cancer in the resected specimen ( p  = 0.02) were significantly associated with higher complication rates. Left-sided resection fields involved two-fold higher complication rates, barely missing statistical significance ( p  = 0.06). Conclusions Pc-RPLND involves a grade III–V complication rate of 14.4%. Prolonged operation time and vital cancer in the residual mass are significantly associated with higher complication rates. The Clavien-Dindo classification system may allow inter-observer variation in rating complication grades, which may represent one reason for the wide range of reported RPLND complication rates. RPLND represents major surgery and surgeons active in this field must be competent to manage adverse events.",

        "content": "Testicular germ cell tumours (GCT) represent the prototype of curable malignancies [ 1 ,  2 ]. The mainstays of therapy are cisplatin-based chemotherapy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). The first ever reported RPLND was performed by the Swiss surgeon Theodor Kocher in 1883 [ 3 ]. Since this pioneering work, the procedure has received an ongoing number of surgical and perioperative refinements [ 4 ]. Today, RPLND is considered a safe surgical procedure in experienced hands [ 5 ]. There are several types of RPLND, the most frequent being post-chemotherapy RPLND (pc-RPLND) which is used for surgical resection of residual retroperitoneal masses after chemotherapy of nonseminomatous GCT [ 6 ,  7 ]. Primary RPLND (p-RPLND) is used less frequently in select cases with clinical stage (CS) 1 and with marker-negative CS 2, in which the operation is performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes [ 8 – 10 ]. In recent years, another type of RPLND has come into use, the laparoscopic RPLND (l-RPLND) [ 11 ]. Surgical complications are an ongoing issue in RPLND. With improvements of surgical and anaesthesiologic techniques the frequencies of complications have significantly decreased over the last decades. The reported rates of surgical complications of RPLND vary widely between 1% and almost 50% [ 12 ,  13 ]. The wide range of reported complication rates can be attributed to two aspects. First, although all types of RPLND are considered major abdominal surgery, pc-RPLND is technically much more challenging than primary resections due to desmoplastic reactions around the great abdominal vessels as an effect of chemotherapy [ 14 ,  15 ]. Sometimes these changes may hinder the access to the natural layers for dissection in the retroperitoneum, thus triggering the need for adjunctive surgical measures [ 16 ]. Therefore, pc-RPLND usually involves higher rates of complications than p-RPLND [ 17 ]. The second reason for the documented range of complications is methodological. Adverse events occurring during surgery or postoperatively may be rated quite differently by various surgeons. To objectify the appraisal of adverse events occurring postoperatively, the international Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification system of for assessing surgical complications was introduced in 2004 [ 18 ]. However, even when this gold standard is applied, interobserver variability still occurs [ 19 ], particularly with respect to minor complications [ 20 ,  21 ]. Furthermore, minor complications not affecting the over-all success of surgery may be ill-documented in archival patient files. Thus, retrospective evaluations of complication rates may overlook or misclassify these minor events and thus result in under-reporting of such complications. The aim of the present study is to retrospectively analyse the surgical complication rates observed in a contemporary cohort of patients undergoing RPLND in two testicular cancer centres in Germany. To obtain meaningful data comparable to other series, we focused on the most frequent type of this surgery (pc-RPLND), and we rated the complications according to the CD classification system [ 18 ]. Furthermore, to avoid misclassifying minor complications in a retrospective chart review, we restricted our analysis to complications grade III to V of the CD system, which represent major complications requiring invasive or otherwise extended therapeutic measures. We also analysed whether particular clinical features are associated with certain complications."

        "content": "The electronic patient archives of Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Hamburg, Germany and Albertinen-Krankenhaus Hamburg, Germany, were retrospectively searched for cases with testicular cancer undergoing RPLND from 2000 to 2017. Three types of surgery were originally included in this study: post-chemotherapy RPLND (pc-RPLND) in cases with residual retroperitoneal masses after chemotherapy, open primary RPLND in CS 1 and CS2 cases (p-RPLND), and laparoscopic primary RPLND (l-RPLND). Four experienced surgeons performed these operations. Post-chemotherapy resections were performed as unilateral template resections in the presence of small residual masses. Larger residual masses usually required bilateral resections. p-RPLND was performed using the Indiana nerve-sparing technique in modified templates [ 22 ,  23 ]. In CS2 patients, bilateral dissections were performed with nerve sparing whenever possible. Laparoscopic resections were confined to unilateral templates. All patients were managed according to contemporary guidelines [ 24 ,  25 ]. Complications were defined as any adverse event occurring intraoperatively or within 30 days after surgery according to the CD system [ 18 ]. Adjunctive procedures during surgery such as nephrectomy, bowel resection or vascular repairs were not considered as complications when they were required for completeness of excision. The following data were abstracted from the files: type of RPLND (p-RPLND, l-RPLND, pc-RPLND), histology of the primary testicular tumour (nonseminoma/seminoma/teratoma as component of nonseminomatous tumour), histology of resected specimen (vital GCT, teratoma, necrosis), patient’s age, body mass index (BMI), duration of the surgical procedure, number of topographic fields resected according to the Weissbach field classification [ 26 ], laterality (left/right side), and in pc-RPLND also cumulative dosage of cisplatin applied prior to surgery (< 500 mg/500–700 mg/> 700 mg); complications (yes/no), grade of complication according to the CD classification [ 18 ]. For final analysis, only major complications were included (grade III–V CD system [ 18 ]). In patients developing more than one complication, only the most severe event was included into the analysis. Our analysis involved four steps: (1) we listed the types of adverse events observed. (2) The frequency of grade III–V complications was assessed according to the three types of surgery. (3) In pc-RPLND, correlations between complications and clinical factors were analysed. Due to the retrospective evaluation, information regarding the various clinical factors was not available in all patients and thus, sample sizes of subgroups vary in this analysis due to missing data. (4) We compared our findings with complication rates of RPLND documented in the literature from 2000 to 2020. The statistical analysis was computed with SPSS software (Version 20, IBM, USA), mainly employing descriptive statistical methods. The chi-squared test was used for statistical comparisons of proportions. A  p  value < 0.05 was considered significant. Ethical consent was obtained from the institutional ethical committee (AEK, U03, Hamburg 12 June 2016). All study activities conformed to the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association (as amended by the 64 th  General Assembly, 2013)."

Factors influencing the complication rates are duration of surgery ≥ 4 ½ h, vital cancer in the resected specimen and, surprisingly, left-sided post-chemotherapy resections. The most frequent type of complication is the occurrence of lymphoceles. A vast number of studies on various aspects of RPLND have been published since the beginning of this century. However, only few provided specific details on complication rates. An overview of contemporary studies providing data on grade III–V complications utilizable for comparison is given in Table  5 . Five studies reported higher rates than the present series [ 27 – 31 ], 10 lower [ 8 ,  12 ,  15 ,  32 – 39 ].\n Table 5 Complication rates of pc-RPLND according to grade III–V of the Clavien-Dindo classification—survey of the literature Complications Caseload Grade III–IV Grade V First author Ref # Year Institution/country n pts/year % % Hendry  a 32 2002 London /UK 442 19.2 5.6 1.1 Pottek a 27 2004 Hamburg/Ger 207 10.4 15.9 0 Spiess a 28 2006 Houston/USA 236 10.3 23.3 1.3 Williams a 8 2009 Boston/USA 92 11.5 9.8 0 Flechon a 29 2010 Lyon/France 151 13.0 14.6 0.7 Subramanian 15 2010 Cleveland/USA 96 13.0 7 1 Luz 30 2010 Montreal/Can 73 4.9 19.2 0 Djaladat 33 2012 Los Angeles/USA 85 12.1 1.2 0 Cary 12 2015 Indiana/USA 755 83.9 1.3 0.3 Considine 34 2016 Dublin/Ireland 78 n.a. 9.0 0 Dusaud 35 2016 Multicenter/France 469 n.a. 2.0 0.2 Wells 31 2016 Multicenter/UK 162 n.a. 17.2 0 Paffenholz 36 2018 Cologne/Ger 162 10.8 7.4 0 Hiester 37 2019 Düsseldorf/Ger 171 10.7 5 1 Gerdtsson 38 2020 Multicenter Sweden/Norway 97 5.0 12.3 0.3 Blok 39 2020 Utrecht/NL/2 ctrs 124 n.a. 9.7 1.6 Present series  2020 Hamburg/Ger/2 ctrs 146 11.1 14.4 0 n.a  not available,  ctrs  centers,  pts  patients,  Can  Canada,  Ger  Germany,  NL  Netherlands,  UK  United Kingdom a These studies did not report according to the Clavien-Dindo system.

In these series, data were rated in analogy to the system, and deaths were considered grade V Caseloads were calculated from published reports according to numbers of patients and time span of patient accrual No perioperative mortality was observed in our series, which is consistent with other recent reports [ 8 ,  13 ,  27 ,  30 ,  31 ,  33 ,  34 ,  36 ]. Low mortality rates of 0.20 to 1.6% [ 12 ,  29 ,  32 ,  35 ,  38 ,  39 ] were reported in some other studies (Table  5 ). In a Dutch series, one death due to anaesthesiological problems was reported [ 40 ]. Based on these data, it may be concluded that perioperative death is exceptionally rare in pc-RPLND. The reported range of major complications is amazingly wide, from as low as 1.2% to up to 23.3% (Table  5 ). There are at least three factors that may explain these widely divergent rates: (1) surgical experience, (2) patient-related factors and extent of the surgical procedure, (3) methodological discrepancies with regard to adherence to the CD classification system. (1) The data compiled in Table  5  indicate that surgical experience might be an important factor influencing the incidence of adverse events. In our opinion, the average number of cases operated per year (caseload) should be considered an indicator for experience, rather than the total number of patients involved in a report. Accordingly, the two studies with the highest caseloads (84/year and 19.2/year) reported the lowest incidences of complications [ 12 ,  32 ]. Conversely, the two studies reporting the highest complication rates had much lower caseloads of 4.9/year and 10.3/year [ 28 ,  30 ]. The significance of individual surgical experience is certainly paramount [ 41 ], and therefore, it has repeatedly been advocated that major surgery such as RPLND should be performed only in dedicated centres of excellence [ 5 ,  42 – 45 ]. In conclusion, one reason for the great variance among reported complication rates may be surgical experience. (2) One patient-related factor that was shown to be associated with higher complication rates is the presence of vital cancer in the resected specimen. This association might be attributed to the size of resected tumours, because larger residual masses contain vital cancer more frequently than small masses [ 46 ]. As size of the residual mass is significantly associated with adjunctive surgical measures [ 47 ], tumour size could be the underlying reason for the association of vital cancer in the specimen with complication rates. Operation time over 4 ½ hours was also shown to be associated with higher complication rates (Table  4 ). However, it is rational to assume that operation time itself is not the cause of complications; rather, prolonged operation time is caused by complex intraoperative situations that may trigger complications. Generally, there is strong evidence for a significant association between age and comorbidity with the frequencies of surgical complications in major urological procedures [ 48 ]. However, testicular cancer is a malignancy typically afflicting young men with no or little comorbidity. Accordingly, in patients aged ≥ 31 years, we did not observe higher rates of grade III–IV complications. In contrast, other reports considered age as a risk factor for intraoperative complications. In a national cohort in the USA, a higher number of adjunctive surgical measures had been employed in patients 35 years or older undergoing RPLND [ 16 ]. However, intraoperative adjunctive measures do not directly translate into higher rates of postoperative complications as shown in the current study. Obesity is another well-known factor impacting the incidence of adverse events upon surgery, mainly wound healing issues, thromboembolic events and respiratory postoperative problems [ 49 ,  50 ]. Accordingly, we found a two-fold higher rate of grade III-IV complications in patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 , but the difference was not statistically significant, probably due to small sample size. Curiously, in the present series, left-sided procedures involved a two-fold higher complication rate than right-sided RPLND, and to our knowledge, this observation has not been reported previously. The result closely misses statistical significance ( p  = 0.06). Yet, the association seems reasonable because left-sided template resections sometimes require extended mobilisation of small bowels and colon, and this surgical manoeuvre may precipitate complications, e.g. small bowel obstruction and postoperative ileus. In accordance with our finding, a Scandinavian study reported a higher rate of adjunctive measures in left-sided resections [ 38 ]. In summary, patient-related factors such as comorbidities, duration of surgery, laterality of procedure, and histology of resected specimen may affect complication rates. Varying incidences of patient-related factors in studies reported in the literature may therefore partly explain the wide range of complications in pc-RPLND. (3) The third factor affecting the reported complication rates of RPLND is the methodology for the assessment of complications. For comparing surgical complication rates among institutions or studies it is paramount to define and classify adverse events in a uniform and objective manner [ 51 ]. Although strong efforts have been made to classify complications in an unambiguous manner by introducing the CD classification [ 18 ], there is still evidence for interobserver discrepancies regarding the assessment of adverse perioperative events [ 19 ,  20 ] particularly concerning surgical site infections [ 52 ]. This was demonstrated in a Canadian survey among urologic surgeons which found an interrater agreement rate of 75% [ 53 ]. The CD system is largely based on the extent of measures to manage complications [ 54 ]. Major complications necessitating clearly defined interventions usually involve high interobserver agreement rates. Conversely, minor complications of grade I–II requiring only conservative measures or just observation involve much more interobserver variation. This was demonstrated in an international survey of 98 urologists, who rated 70 different complications of nephrolithotomy [ 21 ]. In view of several weaknesses of the CD system, modifications have been suggested [ 55 ], but currently it is still considered the gold standard [ 54 ]. In our evaluation of complications of RPLND, we rated a high number of grade I–II complications. In final analysis, we realized that most of these events originally considered as complications were indeed asymptomatic lymphoceles that had been detected incidentally on routine postoperative ultrasound examinations. Other findings such as redness and anejaculation also did not alter the postoperative course. Clearly, these findings are prone to interobserver variation. Therefore, we elected to focus on clearly defined major complications (grade III–V of the CD classification). This is based on empirical evidence that interobserver agreement rates are highest regarding grade V complications (death) and decrease in lower complication grades [ 21 ]. With respect to the widely divergent complication rates of pc-RPLND (1.2–23.3%) summarized in Table  5 , we must certainly acknowledge that apart from surgical expertise and patient-related factors, methodological problems of rating the various types of complications may also contribute to the large variance of reported results. Accordingly, it is not yet empirically possible to clearly define a benchmark or an acceptable upper limit of complication rates. The most frequent complication in our series was lymphocele formation (16% of all grade III–IV complications in all types of RPLND). Accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the abdomen is thought to derive from dissecting and opening of lymphatic vessels without proper ligation during resection of retroperitoneal masses. Whether perioperative low-dose heparin administration for prophylaxis of thromboembolic events may contribute to the development of lymphoceles remains unclear. Vahlensieck was the first to document postoperative retroperitoneal lymphoceles following p-RPLND in 1973 [ 56 ]. Low-dose radiotherapy was used to manage the complication in those cases. In contemporary series of p-RPLND and pc-RPLND, reported rates of lymphocele formation range from 0 to 14.6%, with the majority of studies reporting low rates of 1.5 to 5% [ 15 ,  27 ,  40 ,  47 ,  57 ], but some also report higher rates of 10.9% [ 30 ], 11% [ 38 ], and 14.6% [ 29 ]. Probably, the wide range of lymphocele occurrences reported can be attributed to differences in coding systematics. One may assume that lymphoceles were not accounted for at all in many of the previous reports, unless invasive interventions such as insertion of drainage tubes were required. Accordingly, the case shown in Fig.  1  had only very mild abdominal discomfort according to grade I or II of the CD system despite the rather high volume of lymphatic fluid accumulating in the abdominal cavity. This lymphocele resolved completely within 3 months without specific measures. The main limitation of our study is the retrospective mode of data acquisition. As not all of the adverse events were unequivocally documented in the patient files, some events might have been missed or graded inappropriately. Due to small numbers of events, statistical analysis did not reach significant results in some of the calculations."

        "content": "Complications in pc-RPLND represent a multifaceted problem because adverse events may result from a large number of factors. In the present study, the rate of grade III–IV complications according to the CD system was 14.4% (no postoperative mortality), which is in line with most of the previous reports on this subject. We conclude that it is problematic to define a benchmark or an upper (acceptable) limit of complications because at least three factors may affect complication rates: first, patient-related factors including extent of surgery and comorbidities, second, methodological considerations in rating clinical events as complication, and third, surgical expertise. All in all, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with testicular cancer represents major surgery with a high potential of adverse events. Any surgeon active in this field must be prepared to manage adverse events occurring intraoperatively or during the postoperative course. Patients with testis cancer requiring such type of surgery are probably best advised to attend high-volume specialised referral centres."

    "title": "Arterial elasticity as a risk factor for early cardiovascular disease among testicular cancer survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy: a cross-sectional pilot study",
    "abstract": "Purpose Testicular cancer survivors who have received platinum-based chemotherapy are at risk for premature cardiovascular disease. The etiology of this risk is not well understood. This pilot study explores the impact of platinum-based chemotherapy on endothelial function. Methods Testicular cancer survivors <30 years old at the time of diagnosis who received platinum-based chemotherapy between 2002 and 2012, as well as 17 similarly aged male controls, were identified. Consented subjects underwent vascular assessment using the HDI/PulseWave CR-2000 Cardiovascular Profiling System and the Endo-PAT2000 system. Biomarkers and functional test markers were compared among cases, controls, and a group of historical controls using two sided two-sampled  t -tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results Thirteen survivors with a median age of 30.2 years and body mass index of 27.3 were enrolled, along with 17 healthy controls with a median age of 27.1 years and body mass index of 24.8. Median time from chemotherapy was 4.7 (range: 0.8–14) years. There was no statistical difference in reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry ratio between cases and controls ( p  = 0.574). There was no statistical difference in small or large artery elasticity between cases and controls ( p  = 0.086) or between cases and historical controls ( p  = 0.729). There was also no statistical difference in the blood levels of circulating endothelial cells, von Willebrand factor, and vascular cell adhesion molecules. There was a trend toward increased metabolic syndrome in cases (15%) as compared to recruited controls (6%), though this difference was not statistically significant ( p  = 0.565). Conclusion Testicular cancer survivors have no clinically significant difference in endothelial function compared to controls 4 years after the completion of chemotherapy. Further research is needed to explore the secondary modifiable causes that may contribute to the risk of premature cardiovascular disease.",

        "content": "Testicular cancer is the most common malignancy among 15- to 40-year-old males. 1  In the past 3 decades, the 5-year survival rates of testicular cancer have increased from 63% to >90%. 1 , 2  As cancer survivors are living longer, however, they are more at risk for subsequent therapy-related health complications. Recent studies have suggested that testicular cancer survivors are at risk for premature cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and sudden death. 2 – 5  Among Dutch testicular cancer survivors, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is estimated to be 18% 20 years after completion of therapy. 6 , 7  In evaluating 992 patients diagnosed in the UK between 1982 and 1992, at a median follow-up of 10.2 years, the relative risk of cardiac events was 2–3 folds higher for all survivors who received chemotherapy alone, radiation alone, or combined chemotherapy and radiation, as compared to those who received surgery alone. 8  Other studies have suggested a 5.7-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease in those receiving platinum-based chemotherapy as compared to those receiving surgery alone. 5  The risk appears to be higher in nonseminomatous testicular cancer survivors. The etiology of premature cardiovascular disease in testicular cancer survivors is not known. 3 , 5 , 10 – 12  It has been hypothesized that platinum-based chemotherapy may cause direct, diffuse endothelial damage. 10  This damage is most notable in the first year after chemotherapy. 13 , 14  Platinum-based chemotherapy has also been associated with components of metabolic syndrome: weight gain, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance. 5 , 6 , 9  Secondary endothe-lial damage from metabolic syndrome may also contribute to premature cardiovascular disease. 11  In the present study, we sought to determine whether endothelial dysfunction underlies the etiology of premature cardiovascular disease among testicular cancer survivors. We hypothesized that testicular cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy could have a reduction in small artery elasticity (SAE), suggestive of early atherosclerotic disease, as compared to healthy, noncancerous controls. We, therefore, conducted a cross-sectional pilot study to assess endothelial function among testicular cancer survivors who received platinum-based chemotherapy as compared to healthy controls."

Eligible subjects had received platinum-based chemotherapy, were disease free, had been off therapy for at least 6 months, and were not currently on any ongoing myelosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy. Subjects with a cardiac history (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or cardiac catheterization requiring intervention) were excluded.

Medical record abstraction for cases confirmed the diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, use of chemotherapy, use of radiation therapy, and personal medical history including history of cardiovascular diseases and medications.

This article does not contain any studies with animals performed by any of the authors. Seventeen healthy controls from the Minneapolis and Saint Paul area without a history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or cardiac catheterization were enrolled. After reviewing our data and determining that ~ 30% of our cases and 0% of our controls smoked and knowing that tobacco use can affect vascular disease, we chose to also compare SAE and large artery elasticity (LAE) data from the testicular cancer survivor cohort with a group of historical controls in which a similar number had smoked tobacco. The data from healthy, historical controls were obtained from the Hennepin County Medical Center and previously published. 15  Subjects were matched by age, sex, and smoking status. Subjects with a history of diabetes, hepatitis C, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or cardiac catheterization requiring intervention (stent placement and angioplasty) were excluded. Potential subjects were mailed a letter of recruitment inviting them to participate in the study and have been previously described. 16  A follow-up phone call was placed to the subjects who did not respond. Consented subjects were invited to undergo vascular assessment and biomarker assessment. The consented subjects who completed the protocol received a $50 gift card. The vascular assessment testing procedure has been previously described. 16  Testing was performed using the Endo-PAT 2000 and HDI/PulseWave CR-2000 Cardiovascular Profiling System (Hypertension Diagnostic Inc, Eagan, MN, USA). LAE and SAE are derived from the diastolic pulse contour analysis based on a modified Windkessel model of circulation (model HDI/PulseWave CR-2000 Cardiovascular Profiling System). Before and during the waveform assessment, an automated oscillatory blood pressure (BP) measurement was taken on the contralateral arm. This system has been standardized and correlated with cardiovascular risk factors. Grey et al 17  have demonstrated that SAE is predictive for coronary heart disease events and that LAE and SAE are predictive for heart failure events above and beyond arterial BP. 18  A reduction in reactive hyperemia, assessed by the Endo-PAT ratio (<1.67), has also been correlated with an increase in cardiac events independent of other traditional cardiac risk factors. 19 The flow-mediated dilation examination required the patient to be supine and at rest. Subjects were fasting for 8 hours. All vasoactive medications were withheld for at least 4 half-lives, when possible. The SonoSite Ultrasound system was equipped with vascular software for 2-dimensional imaging, color and spectral Doppler, an internal electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor, and a high-frequency vascular transducer. All study assessments were conducted in a specifically designed research space for clinical vascular assessments. Blood collection and vascular functional measurements were conducted by the same trained vascular technician. The pulse waveform assessments were performed in triplicate, and the mean (average of 3 values for each participant) LAE and SAE indices were used in statistical analyses. Biomarkers were assessed using blood obtained from a fasting draw. Assessments of biomarkers for lipids and inflammatory changes included serum glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), C-reactive protein, plasmino-gen activator 1, tissue-type plasminogen activator, circulating endothelial cells, vonWillebrand factor (vWF), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule, soluble P-selectin, surface P-selectin, and surface vascular cell adhesion molecule. Blood samples were collected prior to vascular functional assessments. Demographic and clinical characteristics of participants by group (cases, controls, and historical controls) were obtained. For triplicate measurements, the average value was used in analysis. Mean ± SD or median and range of the biomarkers and the functional test measurements are presented as appropriate. Differences between young adult survivors of testicular cancer and both control populations (recruited controls and historical controls) were analyzed in terms of the biomarkers and function tests using  t -tests assuming unequal variances and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests as appropriate. Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). A  p -value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

Of these, 14 consented to participate in the study, resulting in an overall participation rate of 20%. One participant was subsequently removed from the analysis when it was determined that he had received radiation therapy alone and no chemotherapy, leaving a final cohort of 13 testicular cancer survivors. Median time between completion of platinum-based chemotherapy and study participation was 4.7 years. The majority of survivors had received combination chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin, with only 1 survivor receiving single-agent carboplatin. Demographic and clinical characteristics of cases, recruited controls, and historical controls are presented in  Table 1 . Mean age of cases was 30.2 ± 4.6 years as compared to 27.1 ± 8.3 years for controls ( p  = 0.2). Testicular cancer cases tended to be Caucasian (92% vs 56%;  p  = 0.044) and overweight in comparison to controls (mean body mass index [BMI] 27.3 ± 8.0 kg/m 2  compared to 24.8 ± 3.6 kg/m 2 ;  p  = 0.31). There was no statistical difference in lipid profiles between cases and controls. In addition, mean systolic blood pressure was elevated in cases (125 ± 11 mmHg vs 113 ± 11 mmHg,  p  = 0.01). There was no difference in free testosterone (11.4 vs 16.5 pg/mL,  p  = 0.10) or total testosterone (4.0 vs 5.4 ng/mL,  p  = 0.09) levels between cases and controls. Smoking status, however, between cases and controls differed markedly (31% vs 0%,  p  = 0.026). As a result of this difference in smoking status, we also compared cases with a historical control group that had a similar proportion of tobacco users. No other demographic or clinical differences between cases and historical controls achieved statistical significance. Cases and historical controls did not differ by age or smoking status ( Table 1 ). Both cases and historical controls were overweight, with mean BMIs of 27.3 ± 8.0 kg/m 2  and 27.8 ± 4.8 kg/m 2 , respectively. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol were comparable between the 2 groups. There was a trend toward higher TG levels among cases (mean: 152.6 ± 124.5 mg/dL vs 120.7 ± 54.9 mg/dL); however, this trend was not statistically significant and was thought to be attributable to 1 outlier.

        "content": "Although there may be a trend toward a reduction in SAE in testicular cancer survivors, there appears to be no clinically significant difference in SAE in survivors of testicular cancer treated with platinum-based chemotherapy as compared with controls 4 years after completing chemotherapy. Despite the risky behavior of tobacco use, we were unable to identify any difference in other cardiovascular risk factors (ie, metabolic syndrome and testosterone levels) between our cases and controls. In comparing our testicular cancer survivors to a group of tobacco-using controls, we also were unable to elucidate any difference in endothelial function. Cisplatin can directly injure cardiac myocytes through oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. 10  In prior investigations, studies have reported quantitative evidence of endothelial dysfunction and damage in testicular cancer survivors. Nuver et al 20  and van den Belt-Dusebout et al 7  measured serum markers of acute inflammation, including vWF, tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, fibrinogen, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. These biomarkers were measured before and 10 weeks after chemotherapy. Acute elevations in these markers were identified. Feldman et al 21  also detected a reduction in SAE through endothelial reactivity at baseline and 34 weeks after chemotherapy ( p  = 0.07). Similarly, Dieckmann et al 10  detected acutely increased vWF after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The vWF values normalized with time, suggesting that direct endothelial damage may occur but that it stabilizes over time after chemotherapy. The data of Dieckmann et al 10  support our hypothesis that the evidence of direct damage stabilizes over time. At 4 years after chemotherapy, as seen in our cohort, this damage seems to have normalized. Similarly, in a recent presentation using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, the risk of direct endothelial damage appears highest in the first year after chemotherapy. 13 , 22  After chemotherapy, there is an increased cardiovascular mortality concentrated within Year 1 after testicular cancer diagnosis (standardized mortality ratio: 5.31,  p  < 0.05). This risk decreases with time since diagnosis. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy may also indirectly lead to cardiovascular disease. Studies suggest that cisplatin-based chemotherapy promotes an increase in risk factors for cardiovascular disease, namely, metabolic syndrome. 2 , 23 , 24  Hyperlipidemia, central obesity, and insulin resistance have been previously described after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. 14  In testicular cancer survivors, metabolic syndrome occurs in 20%–30% of survivors and occurs at an earlier age than expected, generally 3–5 years after therapy. 24 – 26  Metabolic syndrome is a known risk factor for cardiovascular death. In our study, survivors had a trend toward a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome than our control populations. However, in our study, there was no statistical difference in metabolic syndrome between the cases and controls, and no difference in testosterone or free testosterone levels between cases and controls was detected; it is possible that the control of both testosterone levels and risk factors of metabolic syndrome explains why no changes in endothelial function were observed in our study. Features of metabolic syndrome have care targets that can be intervened upon, such as hyperlipidemia reduction, weight management, and glucose control. These risk factors are modifiable in cancer survivors as well. Other studies suggest that low testosterone levels were associated with higher rates of metabolic syndrome (OR: 4.4). 27  Additionally, tobacco use, well known to cause direct cardiovascular toxicity, 28 – 30  was prevalent in our study in which 30% of our testicular cancer survivors smoked. Other studies have reported similar numbers in which tobacco use among young cancer survivors is highly prevalent, 31 – 33  as well as being highly prevalent among testicular cancer survivors specifically. 33  Addressing these modifiable risk factors is vital in caring for these cancer survivors. 34 Our study is limited by its small sample size and low participation rate. If those survivors who did not respond to the study invitation were generally less healthy, this may have affected the study results, introducing some bias. This study is also limited by its cross-sectional nature in which longitudinal data are not available. Additionally, controlling for the discrepancy in race may be important, as other literature suggests that African Americans may have more arterial stiffness and changes in arterial elasticity at baseline; 35  the difference in race between our cohorts may account for the difficulty in interpreting these results. Given the suggestion of reduced SAE and the prevalence of risk factors for metabolic syndrome, longitudinal follow-up of this cohort is warranted. For future studies, however, we propose that interventions take into account race as well as address these modifiable risks factors at the time of completion of chemotherapy."

        "content": "Previously published literature suggests that cisplatin-based chemotherapy causes direct endothelial toxicity. Our data do not support that endothelial damage exists at 4 years following completion of chemotherapy when there are no differences in testosterone levels or metabolic syndrome. Further follow-up, however, is needed. Long-term cardiovascular risk in testicular cancer survivors may be more related to indirect injury or secondary causes. Identifying these risk factors, such as metabolic syndrome, hypogonadism, and associated risky behaviors such as tobacco use, and intervening upon them needs to be done soon after the completion of chemotherapy. Collaboration with other health-care providers will likely be necessary in order to modify these long-term risk factors."

    "title": "The impact of testicular cancer and its treatment on masculinity: A systematic review",
    "abstract": "Abstract Objective The purpose of this review was to synthesise the literature on the topic of masculinity and testicular cancer (TC) and investigate the relative impact of TC on men's view of their masculinity. Methods Searches were conducted across four databases (MEDline, PsycInfo, CINAHL Plus and Scopus) for articles published before April 2022 that included (1) TC and (2) masculinity. Two researchers independently rated studies for inclusion with a third resolving conflicts. Of the 6464 articles screened, 24 articles (10 quantitative and 14 qualitative) were included in the review. Articles were rated for quality and a narrative synthesis was performed. Results Overall, results indicated some men experience a shift in the way they relate to their sense of masculinity following diagnosis and treatment for TC. Being single and without children was related to the experience of negative masculinity‐related outcomes, possibly due to a compounding lack of relational support and being unable to conform to protector, provider traditions. Men who described testicle loss as symbolic of their diminished masculinity were also negatively impacted. However, recent, high‐quality literature on the topic using standardised masculinity measures was limited. Conclusion Some men experience a reduced sense of masculinity after TC, however the impact of TC on masculinity remains person dependent. Further research using validated masculinity measures is required to uncover psycho‐social variables that may account for whether and how meaning is made between TC and its treatment and any subsequent impact on perceived masculinity. Such factors may better support these men in life beyond cancer. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO. International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews: CRD42020185649.",

        "content": "In 2020, 74,458 men worldwide were diagnosed with testicular cancer (TC), accounting for 0.4% of all cancer in men. 1  Whilst a comparatively low incidence to other cancers, TC is the second most common cancer in young men aged 20–39 years  2  TC is characterised by enlarged, hard swelling, affecting one (or rarely, both) testicles. 3  According to the European Association Urology TC guidelines, 4  orchiectomy (i.e., testicle removal) is the standard mainstay of treatment. Due to treatment advances including the introduction of cisplatin‐based chemotherapy, TC has a 98% 5‐year survival rate. 5  As such, focussing on quality of life and survivorship is particularly important for men living beyond TC. 6 For young adults, parallel life events including career disruption and financial insecurity at this formative life stage can complicate long term cancer outcomes. 7  Indeed, for young adults, the suspension of social connection, employment, and independence associated with cancer can significantly impair wellbeing. 7  Younger age at cancer diagnosis is further associated with greater unmet needs 8  and overall psychological distress. 9  Young men (aged 18–24) also face unique, gendered social determinants that correlate with poorer mental health outcomes including poor health service access and engagement, stigma, masculinity and cultural expectations. 10  For men with TC, survivorship issues that can impair wellbeing include above average levels of anxiety and fear of cancer recurrence and depression. 11 ,  12  Psychological distress for men with TC has also been shown to be long‐lasting, with 20% of men meeting clinical cut‐offs for emotional problems 7–10 years after treatment and psychosocial morbidity present in men with TC and partners 5 years after diagnosis. 13 ,  14  This year, TC was shown to have the highest cumulative burden for depression and the highest psychiatric disorder burden overall compared to 25 other cancers. 15  In a recent review, the role of cancer‐related masculine threat (i.e., the perception that cancer is inconsistent with masculine gender) following TC was implicated in some men's heightened levels of depression and anxiety. 16 Masculinity may be of specific importance within the TC context. Biological theories of masculinity suggest that anatomy is a ‘verification’ of gender 17  and thus an altered or damaged reproductive system can have deleterious impacts on one's sense of their ‘manhood’. 18  As testicles have historically been characterised as symbols of strength, courage, and overall masculinity, orchiectomy may influence how men with TC perceive and define themselves. Importantly, one's sense of masculinity is made up of a diverse set of pressures to conform to certain gendered norms and behaviours. These exist on a relative hierarchy of plural masculinities that often coalesce and contradict but reliably place able‐bodied, white, heterosexual men in positions of power over others. 19 ,  20  This dominant expression of masculinity, termed ‘traditional’ masculinity, 21  privileges norms like stoicism, toughness, self‐reliance and invulnerability. These factors are well known to impact survivorship outcomes in men with cancer, including poor rehabilitation uptake, ‘playing down’ side effects from cancer and impaired social, functional and psychological wellbeing. 22 ,  23 ,  24 ,  25  These prevailing masculine ideals directly contradict with the sickness, frailty, vulnerability and physical and financial dependence commonly associated with cancer. 26  The relationship between masculinity and men's wellbeing with cancer is not static, and instead is complex and constantly shifting throughout the various stages of the cancer trajectory from diagnosis to treatment to survivorship. For example, men conforming to traditional masculine norms  before  prostate cancer, being disabled from upholding glorified roles around sexual performance, physical strength and being a ‘breadwinner’ by their cancer can lead to ongoing self‐esteem and body image issues, rumination and distress. 18  Beyond cancer, men with inadequate partner support and post‐treatment sexual dysfunction experienced a sense of diminished masculinity as well as low self‐esteem, creating barriers to open sexual communication with their partner. 27 Whilst the topic of masculinity has been explored in other male cancers (predominantly prostate cancer), in comparison a small body of literature has examined the impact of TC on masculinity and the current findings are mixed. 28 ,  29  In one study, a perceived reduced masculinity was associated with negative adjustment to cancer and depressive symptoms in men with TC. 30  In qualitative research, men have described perceived diminished masculinity (e.g., being physically vulnerable) as an obstacle to thriving in life beyond cancer. 28  Men with TC who demonstrated restricted emotionality and perceived social constraints on the discussion of cancer were associated with depressive symptoms. 31  However, results vary, at times demonstrating that men report transient or little impact to perceived masculinity from TC and its treatment 29  or alternatively describing a sense of strength and success having survived TC. 28 It is unknown why some men feel a reduced sense of masculinity after TC diagnosis and treatment, whereas others report short‐term or no impact. So far, the literature on TC and impacted masculinity suggests that a minority of men experience changes in masculinity. However potential factors that confer risk or resilience to impacted masculinity after TC are largely unknown. The purpose of this review was to synthesise the literature on the topic of masculinity and TC and investigate the relative impact of TC on the men's view of their masculinity. Further aims of this review were to explore correlates of changes to masculinity and investigate whether there are common variables across the literature that may be associated with perceived diminished masculinity due to TC and its treatment."

Seven studies asked participants in a single item measure if they felt less masculine because of TC and its treatment. 37 ,  41 ,  42 ,  43 ,  44 ,  45 ,  46  Five studies used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL questionnaire (4 using EORTC QLQ‐26, 1 using EORTC QLQ‐30) that contains a single item about masculinity (i.e., “ have you felt less masculine as a result of your disease or treatment?’ ”[Version 26 in the past week]), with responses ranging from  1 = Not at all  to  4 = Very much . These studies demonstrated a range of 12%–30% of men feeling less masculine. 37 ,  42 ,  43 ,  44  One of these studies reported those who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) reported greater impairment to self‐reported masculinity. 43  However, another study compared self‐reported reduced masculinity to TC treatment types with no statistical difference. 44  The study with the lowest percentage of men impacted (12%) contained the lowest sample size ( n  = 25) and required all participants to be in a committed heterosexual relationship. 37  The final study compared the EORTC‐QLQ from baseline to follow‐up following intervention (e‐TC), with mean scores ranging from 27.77 to 29.82 suggesting the average response was around “A little bit”. 45 Two studies contained different single‐item measures of masculinity and contained sample sizes of 201 and 401. 41 ,  46  One study asked participants if they felt less masculine as a result of their reproductive problems ( Not at all  to  Very Much ), with 15.5% reporting an impact. 46  Rossen et al. 41  demonstrated significant associations with changes in body image and sexual dysfunction independently to self‐reported reduced masculinity, suggesting a possible impact of physical appearance and function correlating with a greater impact to masculinity. 41 Two studies investigated masculinity in men with TC using study specific scales. 39 ,  40  One study asked men with TC and a healthy control sample to rate themselves on a scale of masculinity and on the same scale how they thought others viewed them. Men with TC rated themselves high in their sense of masculinity and slightly higher than the healthy control on each of these scales, however the difference between populations was a mean of 0.15–0.16 (range  1 = very feminine;  to  5 = very masculine ). However, in another study 206 Norwegian and British men rated themselves on average 1.3–1.4 (range  1 = not at all ; to  4 = very much ) about the extent to which they felt their self‐image as a man had reduced, indicating minimal impact. 40  Participants and doctors w'ere also asked to rate the importance of quality‐of‐life issues, including “Body image/male self‐esteem”. Men with TC ranked body image/male self‐esteem at 2.7 (range  1 = least important ; to  8 = most important ), though doctors overestimated body image/male self‐esteem as their answers almost doubled this mean importance (5.2). Two studies examined correlates of altered perceptions of masculinity. 30 ,  47  Wang and Hoyt 30  found that cancer‐related masculine threat in a sample of younger men ( M age = 25, 18–29 years) was significantly related to worse adjustment to cancer. This study also found that a strong relationship between cancer‐related masculine threat, negative affect and depressive symptoms. However, this effect was buffered by finding benefit from the experience of cancer, such that greater benefit finding attenuated the relationship between cancer‐related masculine threat and a negative affective state. One study reported that in a sample of 161 men, 19% of participants had concerns about dressing in front of others, 47  suggesting some men grapple with vulnerability after TC and its treatment. Age and sexual problems with partners were negatively correlated with concerns about undressing in front of other men, suggesting younger men may be at a greater risk for a reduced sense of masculinity. Interestingly, none of the participants who opted for a prosthesis reported sexual, body image, or undressing (in the presence of others) concerns. 47 There was a total of 14 qualitative articles with sample sizes ranging from 6 to 121 (total sample size = 370). Synthesising the qualitative articles resulted in the emergence of three themes 1) Testicle loss and masculinity, 2) The impact of relationships and 3) Coping in a masculine way, that are described below. Six of the 14 qualitative articles reported at least some men felt a negative relationship between the loss of a testicle and masculine identity. 37 ,  48 ,  49 ,  50 ,  51 ,  52  For the men that felt their masculinity was in some way threatened, losing a testicle was symbolic of losing a part of their identity and feeling incomplete. 48 ,  49 ,  50 ,  51 ,  52  Feelings of inadequacy and emasculation were present 28 ,  35  “it's just the part about being a man and the man having that ability to, and also losing part of that is like losing a part of yourself”. 48  Men who had opted for a prosthesis described wanting to “feel whole again” and feel “like a man”. 50 Six of the 14 qualitative studies reflected that participants tended to conceal themselves in front of other men and potential romantic interests, feeling embarrassed or anxious about revealing the loss of their testicle. 37 ,  50 ,  51 ,  52 ,  53 ,  54  Assumptions were made that other men “don't want to hear it” 51  and men avoided situations that would place them in a position of vulnerability (e.g., locker rooms), 37 ,  50 ,  54  suggesting possible impact of shame and stigma about the possibility of discussing with others. One man also stated that another cancer, such as bowel cancer would be more acceptable to discuss with others, because TC was “different, a little touchy subject” and was afraid of “people bugging me”. 52  Three studies contained participants who had undergone bilateral orchiectomy, meaning both testicles were removed as part of treatment. 51 ,  54 ,  55  These participants reported significant distress that resulted in embarrassment, concealment, and avoidance behaviours. However, other participants felt little relationship between testicle loss and their masculinity. 50 ,  51 ,  56  In one study, a participant described that “being a man is so much more than having two testicles” and that TC and its treatment did not change their own perceptions of their masculinity. 51  These men recognised masculinity beyond their reproductive organs, though were reflective about this relationship, and how it might differ for some men “I think if my whole identity had just been in one little testicle I would have been crushed” and “I don't define my masculinity by a couple of ounces of tissue”. 51  One study reported that when asked directly, none of the participants reported feeling less masculine in any way. 29  All participants in this study were at least 3 years posttreatment and mean age of participants was 35 years, which may suggest men feel their masculinity is restored in life beyond cancer. One study found infertility was viewed as the threat to masculinity as opposed to testicle loss. 57  Schover and von Eschenbach 54  reported that men who were infertile felt they were “of little use” and would have rather kept the cancer than go through life as they do now. In this study, all participants had undergone a RPLND that is related to additional concerns including fertility, scarring and sexual dysfunction. Two studies contained participants who reported the effects of chemotherapy (e.g., weight loss, alopecia, sickness) were a more significant threat to confidence in sexual relationships and identity than the loss of a testicle 54 ,  56  and for one participant created guilt about sexual encounters with his wife. 54 Six of the 14 qualitative articles described how the experience of TC and masculinity was influenced by one's relationship status. 37 ,  48 ,  52 ,  54 ,  56 ,  57  These studies described how men felt that being single did or would have made the experience of TC particularly difficult. Single participants expressed concerns and uncertainty about the idea of explaining testicle loss to a new romantic partner 52  and in an older study restrained themselves from creating relationships altogether. 54  Feeling unsure of oneself, feeling guilty about what they have to offer to prospective partners (i.e., being “damaged goods”), fearing rejection and feeling as if testicle loss was a barrier to connection were all worries participants held, 37 ,  38 ,  48 ,  53 ,  57  indicating a sense of diminished masculinity (e.g., reduced strength, sexual prowess) when considering future sexual encounters. Three studies enquired about participants sexuality. 51 ,  53 ,  54  In one of these studies, conducted in 1984, participants reported worries about the links between TC and being gay, as well as explaining lack of semen to prospective partners. 54  In another study, that focused on factors around help‐seeking for TC, a single participant initially thought TC might be a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and anticipated judgement from doctors. 53 Participants that were already married or partnered and those with children felt they “didn't have anything to prove” in comparison to single men. 56  Achieving these milestones appeared to serve as anchors to masculine security. Partnered participants in one study 48  felt cancer had brought their relationship closer, compared to unpartnered men who felt they were “damaged”. However, this was not true for all single participants. Matheson et al. 56  reported single participants felt optimistic about the future of potential partnership, describing confidence that diminished any worries. Outside of inherent confidence, it is unknown what contributed to these men being unaffected by testicle loss. Rigidity in masculine values and remaining stoic were associated with worse adjustment both quantitatively and qualitatively. 30 ,  56  Men felt “pressure to say, yeah, you're fine”  56  and in one study described that being “weak” and vulnerable was okay for women, but for a man it was “admitting defeat”. 53  Men also struggled with their own view of themselves, feeling pressure to conform to masculine norms including being strong, a provider and survivor, and feeling pressure to ‘suck it up’ and not need others' help. 36 ,  49 ,  53  In one study 56  men were interviewed at two time points, and those that were flexible in adherence to masculine values (e.g., emotional disclosure, seeking support) had fared better than those who demonstrated stoicism and rigidity (e.g., maintaining a ‘false’ positive front, concealing feelings from family and friends). In another study, one man described waiting until his doctor had left the room to cry despite his doctor advising him he was “allowed to show some emotion”. 55  Two studies also described a desire to conform to the role of ‘protector’ and avoid being perceived as ‘sick’, that included shielding family from “bad news”, supporting parents (over themselves) and concealing attendance at follow‐up appointments. 38 ,  57 One study also discussed the role of humour as a way of coping with cancer in a masculine way. 55  Having a good sense of humour served to diffuse tension, increase comradery, and divert attention away from the difficulty of cancer. The application of humour was utilised in healthcare settings (e.g., on the ward with other men and with nurses), at workplaces (to ‘lighten’ the situation and prevent awkwardness) and with friends, to ensure others treated them as the same person (i.e., avoid being treated as a “charity” case). However, some participants further described jokes as only appropriate from trusted friends and family and that other people using humour was insensitive. In another study, within a theme labelled as “too proud for pity”, men described acting in ways to ensure that they were not “felt sorry for”, including ‘controlling’ their emotions to maintain their image as self‐reliant and proud and avoiding help‐seeking and disclosure of TC. In one study with Lebanese men, seeking support directly challenged masculine identity and cultural masculine norms. 57  Another study demonstrated that younger men with TC (<40 years) compared to older men (>40 years) had less knowledge and were offered less material about support and in turn felt continual worry and frustration about their health status in life after cancer. 36  Many men in this study felt that their oncologist did not have time to have the “right conversations”. 36  Men in one study 53  felt that accessing information was “embarrassing” explained by “showing everybody else that you've got something wrong”. Hobbies, including reading, fixing cars, and work, were additionally used as coping mechanisms to keep busy. These were described as ‘health anchors’ that served to help men feel physically active and engaged in interests. 49  Men who did not obtain support felt they would have benefited from a mentor to quell fears of a threatened masculinity and normalise help‐seeking and foster increased connection. 56  Three studies showed men strongly valued informal over professional support, either through “mateship” or from men with lived experience of TC. 38 ,  49 ,  56"

One man also stated that another cancer, such as bowel cancer would be more acceptable to discuss with others, because TC was “different, a little touchy subject” and was afraid of “people bugging me”. 52  Three studies contained participants who had undergone bilateral orchiectomy, meaning both testicles were removed as part of treatment. 51 ,  54 ,  55  These participants reported significant distress that resulted in embarrassment, concealment, and avoidance behaviours. However, other participants felt little relationship between testicle loss and their masculinity. 50 ,  51 ,  56  In one study, a participant described that “being a man is so much more than having two testicles” and that TC and its treatment did not change their own perceptions of their masculinity. 51  These men recognised masculinity beyond their reproductive organs, though were reflective about this relationship, and how it might differ for some men “I think if my whole identity had just been in one little testicle I would have been crushed” and “I don't define my masculinity by a couple of ounces of tissue”. 51  One study reported that when asked directly, none of the participants reported feeling less masculine in any way. 29  All participants in this study were at least 3 years posttreatment and mean age of participants was 35 years, which may suggest men feel their masculinity is restored in life beyond cancer. One study found infertility was viewed as the threat to masculinity as opposed to testicle loss. 57  Schover and von Eschenbach 54  reported that men who were infertile felt they were “of little use” and would have rather kept the cancer than go through life as they do now. In this study, all participants had undergone a RPLND that is related to additional concerns including fertility, scarring and sexual dysfunction. Two studies contained participants who reported the effects of chemotherapy (e.g., weight loss, alopecia, sickness) were a more significant threat to confidence in sexual relationships and identity than the loss of a testicle 54 ,  56  and for one participant created guilt about sexual encounters with his wife. 54"

        "content": "Six of the 14 qualitative articles described how the experience of TC and masculinity was influenced by one's relationship status. 37 ,  48 ,  52 ,  54 ,  56 ,  57  These studies described how men felt that being single did or would have made the experience of TC particularly difficult. Single participants expressed concerns and uncertainty about the idea of explaining testicle loss to a new romantic partner 52  and in an older study restrained themselves from creating relationships altogether. 54  Feeling unsure of oneself, feeling guilty about what they have to offer to prospective partners (i.e., being “damaged goods”), fearing rejection and feeling as if testicle loss was a barrier to connection were all worries participants held, 37 ,  38 ,  48 ,  53 ,  57  indicating a sense of diminished masculinity (e.g., reduced strength, sexual prowess) when considering future sexual encounters. Three studies enquired about participants sexuality. 51 ,  53 ,  54  In one of these studies, conducted in 1984, participants reported worries about the links between TC and being gay, as well as explaining lack of semen to prospective partners. 54  In another study, that focused on factors around help‐seeking for TC, a single participant initially thought TC might be a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and anticipated judgement from doctors. 53 Participants that were already married or partnered and those with children felt they “didn't have anything to prove” in comparison to single men. 56  Achieving these milestones appeared to serve as anchors to masculine security. Partnered participants in one study 48  felt cancer had brought their relationship closer, compared to unpartnered men who felt they were “damaged”. However, this was not true for all single participants. Matheson et al. 56  reported single participants felt optimistic about the future of potential partnership, describing confidence that diminished any worries. Outside of inherent confidence, it is unknown what contributed to these men being unaffected by testicle loss."

        "section_name": "Theme three: Coping in a masculine way",
        "content": "Rigidity in masculine values and remaining stoic were associated with worse adjustment both quantitatively and qualitatively. 30 ,  56  Men felt “pressure to say, yeah, you're fine”  56  and in one study described that being “weak” and vulnerable was okay for women, but for a man it was “admitting defeat”. 53  Men also struggled with their own view of themselves, feeling pressure to conform to masculine norms including being strong, a provider and survivor, and feeling pressure to ‘suck it up’ and not need others' help. 36 ,  49 ,  53  In one study 56  men were interviewed at two time points, and those that were flexible in adherence to masculine values (e.g., emotional disclosure, seeking support) had fared better than those who demonstrated stoicism and rigidity (e.g., maintaining a ‘false’ positive front, concealing feelings from family and friends). In another study, one man described waiting until his doctor had left the room to cry despite his doctor advising him he was “allowed to show some emotion”. 55  Two studies also described a desire to conform to the role of ‘protector’ and avoid being perceived as ‘sick’, that included shielding family from “bad news”, supporting parents (over themselves) and concealing attendance at follow‐up appointments. 38 ,  57 One study also discussed the role of humour as a way of coping with cancer in a masculine way. 55  Having a good sense of humour served to diffuse tension, increase comradery, and divert attention away from the difficulty of cancer. The application of humour was utilised in healthcare settings (e.g., on the ward with other men and with nurses), at workplaces (to ‘lighten’ the situation and prevent awkwardness) and with friends, to ensure others treated them as the same person (i.e., avoid being treated as a “charity” case). However, some participants further described jokes as only appropriate from trusted friends and family and that other people using humour was insensitive. In another study, within a theme labelled as “too proud for pity”, men described acting in ways to ensure that they were not “felt sorry for”, including ‘controlling’ their emotions to maintain their image as self‐reliant and proud and avoiding help‐seeking and disclosure of TC. In one study with Lebanese men, seeking support directly challenged masculine identity and cultural masculine norms. 57  Another study demonstrated that younger men with TC (<40 years) compared to older men (>40 years) had less knowledge and were offered less material about support and in turn felt continual worry and frustration about their health status in life after cancer. 36  Many men in this study felt that their oncologist did not have time to have the “right conversations”. 36  Men in one study 53  felt that accessing information was “embarrassing” explained by “showing everybody else that you've got something wrong”. Hobbies, including reading, fixing cars, and work, were additionally used as coping mechanisms to keep busy. These were described as ‘health anchors’ that served to help men feel physically active and engaged in interests. 49  Men who did not obtain support felt they would have benefited from a mentor to quell fears of a threatened masculinity and normalise help‐seeking and foster increased connection. 56  Three studies showed men strongly valued informal over professional support, either through “mateship” or from men with lived experience of TC. 38 ,  49 ,  56"

        "section_name": "DISCUSSION",
        "content": "The findings of this review indicated that in quantitative research 12%–30% of men report experiencing a reduced sense of masculinity attributed to TC and its treatment. Single men, without children were at a greater risk for masculinity‐related psychological sequelae, consistent with other research in men with TC. 11 ,  58  These men held fears about what they had to offer, and some dwelled on the potential for rejection and embarrassment from prospective partners. The qualitative results indicated that men who hold testicles as symbolic of masculinity tend to be those most affected. A flexible approach to one's own masculinity, as opposed to rigid conformity to traditional ideals enabled positive adjustment and coping with TC, 56  consistent with previous literature demonstrating the negative impacts of the pressure to endorse masculine norms and on poorer mental health outcomes in men. 59 ,  60  Sexual dysfunction and chemotherapy were associated with emasculation, largely related to feeling ‘weak’ and the inability to perform sexually, conflicting with traditional masculine norms. 26  This is consistent with prostate cancer research, where a third of men reported feeling diminished masculinity due to treatment, which was significantly related to sexual dysfunction. 61  Younger age was also identified as a potential risk factors for feeling emasculated from TC and its treatment, though this is largely true for all psychological sequalae from cancer 6  and not all young men with TC were affected. A potentially more important consideration unearthed in this review is that masculine changes (e.g., feeling incomplete) and the psychological sequelae that follows may depend on the personal values and relationships an individual holds about masculinity, testicles and coping with cancer. The  meaning  of losing a testicle, as identified by the individual's perception may moderate the impact the testicle loss has. This may be indicative of pre‐existing masculine beliefs (i.e., biological theory) as men who compared the loss of a testicle to loss of masculinity were likely to experience distress. For other men, losing a testicle meant that these men made assumptions about how others might judge them that compounded their own sense of inadequacy and shame. Moreover, these feelings permeated to other settings, including worries about potential romantic relationships, 52 ,  54  feeling embarrassed and emasculated in front of other men, 51  and feeling a need to be ‘strong’ in the face of coping with cancer. 36 ,  49 ,  53  Men who had opted for a prosthesis were less impacted and indicated a desire to have masculinity ‘restored’. For many men, major life events that occurred before diagnosis, including being partnered and being a father, were protective factors for masculine security. This may be further supporting Smith and colleagues 42  findings that demonstrated a strong correlation between social support and wellbeing and coping in men with TC. Extrapolating to masculinity, it is possible that having a relationship moderates a reduced sense of masculinity. However, only one study contained a standardised measure to assess masculinity. 30  This is consistent with other TC research, where being single was associated with lower self‐esteem and lower mental health 62  and in a recent review demonstrating partnered men with children adjusted more positively to life beyond cancer. 63  Investigation is further needed into whether the percentage of men that are experiencing changes in masculinity are also those that are unpartnered. The earliest five papers 29 ,  37 ,  39 ,  40 ,  54  dated between the years of 1987–2001 demonstrated little impact of TC to masculinity and reported that fears were generally secondary to the fear of death. One variable that may be worth considering is the approval of cisplatin‐based chemotherapy in the late 1970s, 2  that increased TC survival rates from 10% to 85%. It is plausible that men were newly grateful to survive the disease in the first instance than consider the psychological sequelae from TC. There was also some evidence of a discrepancy in psychological distress between older and newer study. 39 ,  42  Extensive scholarship and theorising in the past 2 decades may explain why our understanding of masculinity and the role of masculinity has improved. Literature has moved from singular, reductive conceptions of masculinity to complex and hierarchical plural masculinities that situate each man's gender socialisation as a fluid relational process across time and place. 19 Future research should also consider the emerging positive psychology/positive masculinity model (PPMM) that focuses on leveraging men's strengths to encourage healthy masculine identity constructions and the beneficial aspects of masculinity. 64  These methods have been shown to increase engagement in suicide mental health promotions, a priority area for improving men's health. 65  However, capturing and utilising masculine positivity is still emerging in the literature. 66 ,  67  Considering the pluralities of masculinity that are culture and context dependent, research using contemporary measurement of masculinities are a key priority. Wong's Inventory of subjective masculinity experiences (ISME 68 ) as well as Oliffe's Intentions Masculine Health‐related Values Scale (IHRMVS) 69  are two suggestions that allow for a strengths‐based measurement and analysis of masculinities. In keeping with masculine norms, men most often wished for informal support through other men with TC. 49 ,  56  Some men experienced frustration at being left without information on who and how to connect with others to alleviate their concerns. 36  Some men still felt pressure to cope with cancer in a way that was consistent with adhering to masculine norms, creating an expectation to be self‐reliant and stoic. It's likely then that these men need support for feeling emasculated that upholds their desire for independence and control in an informal setting that allows them to feel comfortable. This systematic review demonstrated that overall, a small proportion of men with TC experience changes to their perceived masculinity. Nonetheless, younger men, single men without children and men who adhere strongly to traditional masculine norms may be at a greater risk for what are often distressing perceived changes to masculinity that impair coping with and beyond cancer. As potential risk factors for negative adjustment to cancer, using collaborative approaches to engage men in positive masculinity models that leverage men's strengths and counteract stereotypes may encourage flexibility in adherence to masculine norms that could further work to reduce distress. Various support groups and infrastructure are available to support men with TC. For example, Movember ( https://au.movember.com/mens‐health/testicular‐cancer ) are a global men's health organisation that provide online support and resources for men with TC, including connecting them with trained ‘guides’ who are men who have experienced TC. Moreover, recent prostate cancer research demonstrated increasing health knowledge for the purpose of maintaining bodily control, engaging in support groups and continuing gendered familial roles supported the maintenance of perceived masculinity. 70  Whilst this has not been evaluated in the TC population, for all men, clear conversations about life beyond cancer and information and referrals to connect with others should be included as part of treatment for TC. Health care providers are in prime position to discuss services with men with TC, however being attuned to and anticipating men's treatment needs and recognising patterns of masculine behaviour men's needs are key to men's engagement. 71 This review also demonstrated discrepancies between doctors' and patients' perceptions of masculinity and that men were hesitant to show emotion or ask for information from their medical team. However, most studies in this review did not discuss the role of medical influence and service providers for men with TC and how this is related to masculinity and coping with cancer. It is important that future studies both enquire about how these settings influenced their experience of cancer, and that measurements such as patient reported outcomes are always completed by patients rather than clinicians. Recommendations have been made previously about ensuring survivorship care planning is a standard component in TC management, also based on discrepancies between patients' and care providers' expectations. 72  Survivorship care plans that encourage the protection and maintenance of perceived masculinity and supporting psychological flexibility may be particularly useful. The strengths of this review include following best practice guidelines for systematic reviews, including prospective registration with PROSPERO, and reporting aligned with both PRISMA and ENTREQ guidelines. Further, expanded search terms were utilised so that there was minimal chance of missing relevant articles to the topic. Finally, abstract and title and full text screening were conducted independently by two coders, as were the quality of article ratings. The review also had limitations. Whilst every effort was given to obtain all literature pertaining to the topic, there is the possibility that research articles were missed. Further, in the quantitative literature only one study utilised a standardised measure of masculinity, meaning there are limitations in the reporting of significance and power of masculinity results. Researcher bias may have influenced the synthesis of qualitative studies. Whilst comprehensive analysis of results and conclusions were undertaken, a single researcher extracted themes and their own perspectives could have influenced the description of these themes. Whilst several studies considered the impact to masculinity, many did not investigate the participant's definition of masculinity and as such the authors are also unable to comment on differing views of the meaning of masculinity. There were also broader limitations related to the assessment and understanding of masculinity and TC. As a construct, masculinity is complex and quantitative questionnaires can be narrow and carry stereotypical assumptions about the pressures that men face. Multiple masculinities are widely recognised, that vary by culture, relational comparison, social roles and time. 19  Many of the studies within this review were cross‐sectional in nature, and did not consider broader contextual factors (e.g., employment) that would have given more confidence in whether perceived impacted masculinity was due to TC or other causes. Moreover, many studies were conducted in high‐income countries (e.g., Australia and Canada) indicating the potential for reduced diversity in patient populations. Considering demonstrated racial, ethnical and class disparities in cancer survival rates including men with TC, 73  future investigation in this area could consider minority populations. Future research should be to consider and control for social and cultural influences that may influence masculinity in men with TC. Only three studies investigated sexual identity and to our knowledge no study asked individuals if they identified as a man. Further, links between sexual diversity and masculinity are not understood. As an improvement for research in this area, sexual and gender identity should be considered when investigating the experience of TC and masculinity. In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrated some men experience a reduced sense of masculinity as a result of TC and its treatment. Underlying vulnerabilities to distress may also include those that hold meaning to the relationship between testicle loss and masculinity and those that are single and without children at the time of diagnosis. However, these predisposing variables do not result in distress for all men with TC. Further research is needed using validated masculinity measures to improve the quality of the current literature on the topic. Future research in this area should also aim to investigate what psychological factors may work to explain the differentiation or susceptibilities to whether men with TC are impacted or not in their sense of masculine self. Understanding these risk factors could inform the prevention of psychological distress in men with TC."

    "title": "Predicting Hearing Loss in Testicular Cancer Patients after Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy",
    "abstract": "Simple Summary To our knowledge, this is the first study that presents a machine learning setup incorporating genetics and clinical factors to predict hearing loss in a large and fairly unique cohort of testicular cancer patients, with follow-up data examining long-range side effects of chemotherapy. Genetic variants in  SOD2  and  MGST3  are proposed as mechanistically associated with cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Further, the models in this study focus on individual patient benefit and incorporation of quality of life measures to identify hearing loss impact. To study short- and long-term effects of chemotherapy, testicular cancer is ideal as a model disease for other cancers, as patients are young with long life-expectancy and without significant comorbidity. With small adjustments, the model can likely be applied in the treatment of other cancers where cisplatin is used, thus helping with choice of treatment without risking a trade-off in efficacy, standing to influence clinical practice. Abstract Testicular cancer is predominantly curable, but the long-term side effects of chemotherapy have a severe impact on life quality. In this research study, we focus on hearing loss as a part of overall chemotherapy-induced ototoxicity. This is a unique approach where we combine clinical data from the acclaimed nationwide Danish Testicular Cancer (DaTeCa)-Late database. Clinical and genetic data on 433 patients were collected from hospital files in October 2014. Hearing loss was classified according to the FACT/GOG-Ntx-11 version 4 self-reported Ntx6. Machine learning models combining a genome-wide association study within a nested cross-validated logistic regression were applied to identify patients at high risk of hearing loss. The model comprising clinical and genetic data identified 67% of the patients with hearing loss; however, this was with a false discovery rate of 49%. For the non-affected patients, the model identified 66% of the patients with a false omission rate of 19%. An area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) curve of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71–0.74) was obtained, and the model suggests genes SOD2 and MGST3 as important in improving prediction over the clinical-only model with a ROC-AUC of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.65–0.66). Such prediction models may be used to allow earlier detection and prevention of hearing loss. We suggest a possible biological mechanism for cisplatin-induced hearing loss development. On confirmation in larger studies, such models can help balance treatment in clinical practice.",

        "content": "Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men below 40 years of age in developed countries with a continuously rising incidence in many countries [ 1 ]. It is a highly curable disease with a 5-year survival of more than 90% disregarding initial stage, which results in an increasing population of long-term testicular cancer survivors (TCS) [ 2 , 3 ]. Treatment for patients with disseminated disease includes a multi-modality approach with initial orchiectomy and either radiotherapy or, most frequently, chemotherapy, followed by possible secondary surgery. Standard chemotherapy is bleomycin–etoposide–cisplatin, which has been the standard of care since the early 1980s [ 4 ] in generally unchanged regimens. While treatment is associated with high cure rates, it is hampered by late effects such as ototoxicity, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and cardiovascular disease [ 5 , 6 ]. Prevalence of ototoxicity has been associated with cumulative cisplatin doses and age at diagnosis. For example, with every 100 mg/m 2  increase in cisplatin dose, a 3.2 dB decrease in age-adjusted hearing threshold has been identified [ 7 ]. In a large cross-sectional study, hearing impairment was reported in 21% of patients who received chemotherapy compared to 12% in those who did not [ 8 ]. In another cross-sectional study, 18.3 years after treatment, treatment with BEP was associated with 2.4–2.8 times increased risk of self-reported ototoxicity [ 9 ]. There is, however, considerable interindividual variability, which may be caused by genetic factors [ 9 , 10 , 11 ]. Platinum ototoxicity has been associated with death of hair cells in the organ of Corti, which reside within a blood–labyrinth barrier [ 10 , 12 ], which may hold a key to understanding the variability of toxicity. There is a need for further identification of risk factors to more accurately ascertain which patients are at risk of ototoxicity and possibly initiate preventive measures. In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors for hearing loss after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, as part of ototoxicity, in TCS via the usage of a prediction logistic regression model integrating clinical and genetic data to address the burden of cisplatin-induced hearing loss."

        "content": "Long-term TCS were identified in the DaTeCa-Late cohort [ 13 ] with patients initially treated for testicular cancer in Denmark from 1984 to 2007. All patients in this cohort filled in a range of questionnaires related to late toxicity from January 2014 to December 2016 ( n  = 2572). Clinical features were identified in hospital files [ 14 ]. In October 2014, 433 of these TCS who had received one line of treatment were asked to deliver a saliva sample for genotyping, as previously described [ 15 ]. Patients gave informed consent to participate in this study, and the study was approved by the regional ethical committee (File number, H-2-2012-044) and the National Board of Data Protection (File number, 2012-41-0751). All patients received bleomycin–etoposide–cisplatin (BEP) for disseminated testicular cancer, for three cycles or more, as previously described [ 15 ]. The majority received cisplatin 20 mg/m 2  and etoposide 100 mg/m 2  for five days each cycle, while 43 (10%) received double-dose cisplatin (40 mg/m 2 ) and etoposide (200 mg/m 2 ) as part of a research protocol. Bleomycin was administered at a dose of 15.000 IE/m 2  with a cumulative maximum dose of 150.000/m 2 . Clinical information consisted of age at diagnosis and at time of completion of the questionnaire, body mass index (BMI), glomerular filtration rate before treatment, cumulative cisplatin dose per square meter of body surface area (BSA), number of BEP cycles, histology (seminoma vs. non-seminoma), prognostic classification as per International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) [ 16 ], alcohol consumption (units/week), and smoking habits (never; former; or current). BMI, alcohol, and smoking information were collected at the time of the questionnaire. Age at time of completion of the questionnaire was correlated with age at diagnosis (Pearson correlation 0.76) and omitted for further analysis. Self-perceived hearing loss was assessed with the Ntx subscale of the FACT/GOG-Ntx-11, version 4, which evaluates the severity and impact of neuropathy [ 17 ]. The questionnaire consists of 11 items rated from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The scale can be divided into four subscales: sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy, auditory neuropathy, and dysfunctional problems [ 17 ]. Auditory neuropathy comprises two different questions, where FACT/GOG-Ntx6 measures difficulty hearing, and FACT/GOG-Ntx7 measures tinnitus ( Supplementary Note S1 ). Here, we aim at predicting hearing loss; thus, only FACT/GOG-Ntx6 is further explored. FACT/GOG-Ntx6 and FACT/GOG-Ntx7 were not strongly correlated, which may indicate different biological etiologies. For FACT/GOG-Ntx6, to ensure clinical relevance, the outcome was dichotomized. Low-risk (score from 0 to 1) and high-risk groups (score from 2 to 4) were considered. It is important to point out that the FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire was completed in 2014, and patients had answered FACT/GOG-Ntx6 according to their current experience of hearing levels. However, at that time, the patients were also asked if they recalled experiencing worse hearing during treatment (hearing change question 1, HC Q1), and whether it returned to normal afterwards (hearing change question 2, HC Q2). Even though HC Q1 and HC Q2 are not validated at the same level as FACT/GOG-Ntx [ 17 ], we used Spearman’s rank correlation between FACT/GOG-Ntx6 and HC Q1 and HC Q2 to understand if the reported patients’ hearing loss at the time of the FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire was due to cisplatin treatment. DNA samples were prepared at DTU Multi-Assay Core (Lyngby, Denmark) and genotyped at AROS Applied Biotechnology A/S company (Aarhus, Denmark) using Illumina ®  HumanOmniExpressExome-8-v1-2-B-b37 chip (approximately 1 million markers). Genotyping data were converted into pedigree format using GenomeStudio ®  (v2011.1) with PLINK Input Report Plug-in (v2.1.3). Variants with genotyping call rate < 0.98, not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium ( p  value < 5 × 10 −6 ), or with a minor allele frequency < 0.01 were excluded. Quality control for both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and patient samples is described in detail in  Supplementary Figure S1 . SNPs were selected via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) within a nested cross-validated logistic regression (described in “Statistical Analysis”) and a systematic review search. Genes linked with cisplatin metabolism or ototoxicity were obtained ( Table 1  and  Supplementary Note S2 ) from databases Uniprot [ 18 ], DrugBank [ 19 ], KEGG [ 20 , 21 , 22 ], and BioCyc [ 23 ]. SNPs from our dataset were gene-annotated with Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) [ 24 ], and SNPs located in the database-derived prior genes were extracted. SNPs were further filtered using Ensembl VEP for high functional impact or drug response, thus prioritizing 19 SNPs representing prior knowledge:  CYP2J2  rs11572279,  MGST3  rs9333378,  ABCA12  rs10498027,  ABCC5  rs939336,  WFS1  rs1801206,  SLC44A4  rs494620,  NOX3  rs12195525,  CEP78  rs17787781,  CYP2C9  rs4917639,  CYP2C8  rs2071426,  SYCE1  rs2149616,  ABCC8  rs2074308,  DUSP6  rs808820,  DMXL2  rs2414105,  ABCA10  rs10491178,  ABCA7  rs3752229,  CYP2B6  rs2279345,  ERCC1  rs3212986,  MCM8  rs3761873. Additionally, seven SNPs reported to be associated with cisplatin-induced hearing loss in a recent systematic review [ 25 ] were included:  LRP2  rs2075252,  LRP2  rs4668123,  TPMT  rs1800460,  SOD2  rs4880,  GSTP1  rs1695,  COMT  rs4646316,  COMT  rs9332377. All patients included after quality control had complete hearing loss outcome data. In patients with missing values in predictors (for BMI and smoking), a multiple imputation method [ 26 , 27 ] with ten iterations was used. A nested five-outer, five-inner cross-validation logistic regression was implemented using SciKit-learn [ 28 ] (v0.23.2) in Python (v3.6.10). As performance was similar across other machine learning models (random forests and artificial neural networks), the more simplistic logistic regression was chosen to be closest to interpretability and eventual implementation. Forward feature selection and parameter optimization were performed in the inner training-validation sets, and the model was deployed on the outer test sets. Initially, only clinical data were included in the model. The area under the ROC-AUC was used to evaluate the model’s prediction ability. An increasing number of clinical features was evaluated in exhaustive combinations until the ROC-AUC reached a plateau. The genetic data were then added to the model. A cross-validated GWAS was performed on the inner training sets to select SNPs for model training. Genetic variants were tested for association with hearing loss using logistic regression (PLINK [ 29 ] (v1.9)) adjusting for potential confounding effects: age at time of questionnaire and cisplatin dose. A suggestive  p  value threshold of 1 × 10 −4  was used to select SNPs for model training ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). Then, forward feature selection was performed on the combined dataset comprising both SNPs identified through GWAS and a systematic review search, along with the clinical data. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values [ 30 ] helped interpret the impact of individual features contributing to the model’s performance. The dataset was randomly split 30 different times in training, validation, and test sets to ensure model reproducibility and robustness. More information on model hyperparameters, encoding of variables, and feature normalization is included in  Supplementary Note S3 . For the model with clinical data only, permutation tests were applied to ensure the model was not fitting random noise. For the model with clinical and genetic data, this was achieved by adding randomly selected SNPs."

        "content": "Out of 478 patients from the Danish Testicular Cancer (DaTeCa)-Late cohort [ 13 ], 45 patients who received more than one line of treatment were excluded in the present study; therefore, 433 patients were available. Out of these 433 patients, 424 filled in the FACT/GOG-Ntx6 question on self-perceived hearing loss. Of those, 146 (34.4%) patients scored 2 to 4, phenotypical hearing loss. These affected patients had a median age at diagnosis (interquartile range (IQR)) of 34 (27–41) years, while non-affected ( n  = 278) patients had a median age (IQR) of 29 (26–36) years. Demographic features are presented in  Table 2 . After genotype quality control, 393 patients with data on 611,129 SNPs were available for analysis ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). In this study, we used the FACT/GOG-Ntx-11 version 4, which provides a targeted assessment of peripheral neuropathy such as auditory neuropathy. Auditory neuropathy comprises two different questions, where FACT/GOG-Ntx6 measures difficulty hearing, and FACT/GOG-Ntx7 measures tinnitus ( Supplementary Note S1 ). A moderate correlation was observed between FACT/GOG-Ntx6 and FACT/GOG-Ntx7 (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient 0.55). Additionally, the patients were asked if they recalled experiencing worse hearing during treatment (hearing change question 1, HC Q1) and whether it returned to normal afterwards (hearing change question 2, HC Q2). In order to understand if the patient’s hearing loss at the time of the FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire (2014) was due to cisplatin treatment (between 1984 and 2007), we investigated the correlation between these questions as well. FACT/GOG-Ntx6 from the validated FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire showed a high correlation with HC Q2 concerning self-perceived long-lasting changes after treatment (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient 0.56 for HC Q1 and 0.76 for HC Q2). First, the prediction ability of the routinely available clinical information was assessed. Nine features were incrementally included in the model through exploring exhaustive permutations with each single feature addition. The two most informative clinical features (receiver operating characteristic curve ROC-AUC of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.65–0.66),  Figure 1 A,C)—age at diagnosis and number of treatment cycles—were prioritized for further modeling and combined with genetic data from the SNP array chip. Prediction performance, assessed as ROC-AUC, reached a plateau when six genetic features were added to the model (in addition to the two most informative clinical parameters), with a mean ROC-AUC of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71–0.74) ( Figure 1 B,D and  Figure 2 A). The most informative SNPs were:  SOD2  rs4880,  MGST3  rs9333378, intergenic rs4389005,  ABCA10  rs10491178,  ABCA12  rs10498027,  MCM8  rs3761873 ( Table 3 ). Out of 30 models, these SNPs were selected 15, 9, 7, 6, 5, and 4 times, respectively ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Only the intergenic rs4389005 has been pre-selected from the cross-validated GWAS. All other SNPs had a  p  value > 1 × 10 −4  and were pre-selected from a systematic review of genes shown to be related with cisplatin metabolism or ototoxicity. The two most influential SNPs according to SHAP metrics [ 30 ] were  SOD2  rs4880 and  MGST3  rs9333378 ( Figure 3 ). Homozygous genotypes for the risk alleles  SOD2  rs4880:AA and  MGST3  rs9333378:AA were found in 47% of patients who replied FACT/GOG-Ntx6 = 0 or 1, 63% of patients who replied FACT/GOG-Ntx6 = 2, and 76% of patients who replied FACT/GOG-Ntx6 = 3 or 4 (chi-squared  p  value 1 × 10 −4 ). For each sample, prediction scores ranged between 0 and 1, where a value closer to 1 indicated a higher probability of hearing loss. Using a default cut-off of 0.50, a sensitivity of 67% was reached and a positive predictive value of 51%. Correspondingly, this resulted in a specificity of 66% and a negative predictive value of 80% ( Figure 2 B). The model performed best on patients with the highest toxicity ( Figure 2 C). For most patients (320 out of 393), adding genetic data improved hearing loss prediction; however, for 42 out of 320, this was still not enough to correctly classify these patients. In 7 out of 393 patients, the addition of genetic data led to misclassification. For 55 out of 393 patients, neither clinical nor genetic data helped on prediction and/or classification ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). Overall, we were able to improve prediction performance when adding genetic features to clinical data (ROC-AUC 0.73) compared to the models with only clinical data (ROC-AUC 0.66). To test robustness and non-randomness of the selected models, in the models with only clinical data, all variables were permutated, which led to a mean ROC-AUC close to 0.50 throughout the forward feature selection ( Supplementary Figure S4A ). The mean ROC-AUC for the random model with two features was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.49–0.51) ( Supplementary Figure S4B ). In an additional test, random genetic variants were added to the model with the informative clinical features (age at diagnosis and number of treatment cycles). Mean ROC-AUC was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66–0.68) for the model with six random genetic variants and two informative clinical features ( Supplementary Figure S4D ), which was not so different from the ROC-AUC with two clinical features only (ROC-AUC of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.65–0.66)), indicating that the random genetic variants were indeed not adding any relevant information for the prediction. From this point on, ROC-AUC started to steadily decrease as more randomly selected SNPs were added to the models ( Supplementary Figure S4C )."

        "content": "In this study, we present a model for the prediction of hearing loss after cisplatin-containing chemotherapy based on a combination of clinical and genetic features, achieving a classification performance of ROC-AUC 0.73. We observed an improved prediction after the inclusion of genetic data compared to clinical data only. Age at diagnosis and number of treatment cycles were the most important clinical predictors, matching what has previously been reported [ 7 , 9 , 31 ]. We have focused on hearing loss as part of ototoxicity, as we did not observe a strong correlation between hearing loss (FACT/GOG-Ntx6), and tinnitus (FACT/GOG-Ntx7), which may indicate independent biological mechanisms. Indeed, not all people who suffer from hearing loss have tinnitus, and vice versa, and studies on the genetics behind tinnitus are still at an early stage [ 32 , 33 ]. The first SNP selected in the model, the functional rs4880 SNP, is located on codon 16 exon 2 of  SOD2  that codes for the superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), a mitochondrial protein [ 34 ]. SNP rs4880 is the most studied  SOD2  SNP [ 35 ]; however, there is no agreement regarding how it influences SOD2 enzymatic activity. SNP rs4880 (A > G, Val16Ala) is predicted to change the structure of the SOD2 mitochondrial targeting sequence, converting a beta-sheet secondary structural motif to a partial alpha-helix [ 36 ]. Some state that due to partial arrest of the beta-sheet structure during transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane, this will likely inhibit efficient mitochondrial import of Val-SOD2 precursors and, thus, reduce enzyme activity [ 37 ]. A follow-up study has reported that the Ala variant, associated with increased SOD2 activity according to the previously mentioned study, was associated with hearing damage in cisplatin-treated pediatric medulloblastoma [ 38 ]. However, others have measured SOD2 activity and observed that it was lower in  SOD2  rs4880:GG individuals compared with  SOD2  rs4880:AA, or  SOD2  rs4880:GA [ 39 ]. The second SNP selected in the model, SNP rs9333378, is located in  MGST3 , that codes for the microsomal glutathione S-transferase 3 (MGST3) [ 34 ]. Among the microsomal glutathione S-transferases, MGST1, MGST2, and MGST3 have been reported to be important in the detoxification process [ 40 ]. Here, we hypothesized a combined effect of  SOD2  rs4880 and  MGST3  rs9333378 on cisplatin-induced hearing loss. When platinum enters the cells, it is metabolized by the mitochondria, which will lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide. SOD2 will then degrade superoxide into hydrogen peroxide until complete superoxide anion degradation. If SOD2 is prevented from entering the mitochondria due to partial arrest of beta-helix, this may lead to an accumulation of ROS. ROS cause lipid peroxidation, activation of pro-inflammatory factors, and cell death by apoptosis, including hair cells [ 41 , 42 ]. Indeed, we observed the A-allele with a higher frequency in patients who reported hearing loss (odds ratio = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.13–2.13), contrary to what has been reported previously [ 38 ]. Furthermore, glutathiones, including glutathione S-transferase, are known to help with complete superoxide anion degradation [ 38 ]. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database [ 43 ] reports lower MGST3 expression levels for rs9333378:AA compared to the rs9333378:GG genotype in the brain. It is hypothesized that the rs9333378 variant leads to accumulation of cisplatin in the hair cells through decreased MGST3 activity. Additionally, potential novel variants associated with cisplatin-induced hearing loss were selected on the logistic regression model. SNP rs4389005 located in an intergenic region was found in the cross-validated GWAS. The closest gene is  GPR12  (64 kilo base pairs 5′ to canonical transcription start site), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs have been seen to be involved in several physiological and pathological functions [ 44 ]. The subsequent SNPs, found via systematic review search, and with contribution to model performance, were SNPs  ABCA10  rs10491178 and  ABCA12  rs10498027, both leading to stop-gains within the ABCA genes which encode ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Overexpression of ABC transporters have been associated with multidrug resistance, including cisplatin, in multiple tumors [ 45 ].  ABCA10  rs10491178:GG has been associated with lower expression of ABCA6 [ 43 ], which can lead to higher sensitivity to cisplatin and higher toxicity [ 46 ].  MCM8  rs3761873 was the last SNP selected by the model, which leads to a stop-gain.  MCM8  encodes the mini-chromosome maintenance 8 homologous recombinant repair factor protein (MCM8), and in a recent mouse study, inhibition of MCM8 (and MCM9) hypersensitized cells to cisplatin [ 47 ]. While we observed a false discovery rate of 49% using a 0.50 cut-off, it is promising to see that only four of the twenty-three patients with the highest score (FACT/GOG-Ntx6 = 4) were misclassified. Three of them had a prediction score very close to 0.50 (two patients with 0.48 and one with 0.49 prediction scores). The last misclassified patient had a prediction score of 0.31 and was also the youngest of the 23. Furthermore, he received one of the lowest amounts of cisplatin (300 mg/m 2  and three treatment cycles). This points to other relevant features that led this patient to develop hearing loss, either clinical or genetic predispositions that might be underrepresented in this dataset and, hence, may not have been detected. The diagnosis of hearing loss is challenging to perform, and its definition is still far from being robustly defined [ 48 ]. Here, several potential factors for hearing loss were not explored, such as noise, infection, or vascular problems, and the toxicity was assessed several years after exposure. However, long-term toxicity also has a high impact on quality of life [ 9 ] and may be important to predict for balancing treatment intensity. The models were trained on labels that derive from the FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire, which are not objectively quantified. Other measurements, such as pure-tone audiometry, which are not yet implemented routinely in clinical practice, could have been undertaken to improve precision [ 48 ]. On the other hand, using quality of life measures ensures that the focus is on the patient [ 49 ]. For instance, objective measurements might detect a similar level of toxicity between two individuals; however, only one may be affected by the symptoms and, thus, objective measurements may not be a true assessment of quality of life. Further, BMI, as well as information about alcohol consumption and smoking habits, were retrieved in 2014 when the questionnaire was completed. These clinical features were used as a proxy at the time of treatment, but they may not represent the true values. While those features were not selected in the final model, we are unaware if the real values at the time of treatment could have added relevant information to the model. Incorporating longitudinal data, such as information collected one year after treatment, could also have been advantageous in further improving the model’s performance. Finally, models in this study were trained on 393 patients adhering to most of the best practices of healthcare-related prediction models [ 50 ] using a logistic regression with cross-validated GWAS; nonetheless a future replication on a larger and independent patient cohort would be warranted. Cisplatin is essential in treatment of several neoplasms; however, the inability to predict how patients will react to chemotherapy represents a major challenge, and hearing loss is one of the most common late side effects of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In this study, we present a logistic regression with cross-validated GWAS prediction model based on a combination of genetic and clinical features able to classify patients at high (67% sensitivity), or low risk (66% specificity) of hearing loss after cisplatin-based treatment. We also propose a combined effect involving  SOD2  rs4880 and  MGST3  rs9333378 on cisplatin-induced hearing loss development. In our study, these SNPs have not yielded significant results when single associations between SNPs and outcome have been performed; thus, a combination of cross-validated GWAS and systemic review search is suggested as a feature selection approach for machine learning. Following confirmation in a prospective clinical setting and replication in larger independent studies, such a model could be used as a complement to support clinical decision-making and help in reducing hearing loss cases by adjusting treatment for patients in the high-risk group, especially with treatment of other cancers where cisplatin is used."

        "content": "A 40‐year‐old man was admitted to our hospital with a 15 cm right testicular tumor. High inguinal orchiectomy was performed, and pathological diagnosis was seminoma, pT1. A systemic survey showed no metastasis, resulting in assignment to stage I. The patient selected the option of surveillance without adjuvant therapy. One month after surgery, CT showed enlarged pelvic lymph nodes, and the patient was diagnosed as having nodal metastasis. The International Germ Cell Consensus Classification was good prognosis. Therefore three cycles of BEP chemotherapy were planned. The patient complained of nausea and constipation from day 4, without vomiting or loss of consciousness. On day 8, although hyponatremia (Na 126 mEq/L) was observed, gastrointestinal symptoms did not deteriorate, and bleomycin was administered in accordance with the regimen. On day 9, he suffered from vomiting (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0, Grade 2) and disorientation (Grade 1). Serum sodium level was decreased to 110 mEq/L. Urinary and plasma osmolality were 740 and 231 mOsm/L, respectively. ADH was 10.1 pg/mL (~4.2 pg/mL). Renal, thyroid, and adrenal dysfunctions were excluded. Thus, SIADH was diagnosed. His symptoms gradually improved after administration of 3% hypertonic saline and extra salt intake (Fig.  1 ). On day 15, febrile neutropenia prevented the administration of bleomycin. The patient recovered from febrile neutropenia with antibiotic treatment. For the second and third chemotherapy courses, serum sodium was frequently monitored (Fig.  2 ), and hyponatremia was treated by restricting water intake to 800–1000 mL/day and prescribing salt intake of 3.0–4.5 g/day besides meals. Serum sodium was maintained at >130 mEq/L. Mild digestive symptoms without hyponatremia‐related symptoms were recorded. Lymph node metastasis disappeared on CT after three courses of BEP chemotherapy. Clinical course and serum sodium level of the first course of chemotherapy.

        "content": "SIADH is a serious adverse event associated with chemotherapy regimens containing cisplatin. SIADH was first reported as a syndrome of hyponatremia due to abnormal secretion of ADH by Schwartz  et al . 1  Diagnostic criteria include (i) hyponatremia with corresponding hypoosmolality of the serum and extracellular fluid, (ii) continued renal excretion of sodium, (iii) absence of clinical evidence of fluid volume depletion, (iv) urine osmolality greater than that appropriate for the concomitant plasma osmolality, and (v) normal function of kidney, thyroid, and parathyroid. 2 ,  3 ,  4  All these criteria were fulfilled in the present case. The causes of SIADH include malignant tumors, central nervous system disease, pulmonary disease, and side effects of drugs. Some anticancer agents have been reported to cause SIADH, such as vincristine, vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, and cisplatin. 2 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9  The pathogenesis of SIADH caused by cisplatin is still unknown, but it is believed that suppression of Na reabsorption in the ascending limb of Henle in the renal tubules is involved. In patients who undergo chemotherapy, ADH secretion is promoted by vomiting or fluid infusions. 5 ,  8 The treatment of SIADH is based on hypertonic saline administration and fluid restriction. In acute phase (<48 h after onset), a rapid correction of serum sodium level should be performed. However, in the chronic phase (>48 h after onset), serum sodium elevation should be carefully controlled because there is evidence that rapid overcorrection is associated with a risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. 3 ,  6 ,  10  In the present case, after starting to correct serum sodium levels there was an increase to 12 mEq/L per day in the first 24 h. Water was administered freely to adjust the speed of correction, as this hyponatremia was judged as chronic because nausea had already occurred from day 4. Although salt intake is not usually necessary for the treatment of SIADH, it was given in this case to compensate for the increase in urinary sodium excretion. As chemotherapy‐induced hyponatremia is a serious adverse event, chemotherapy regimens are commonly modified and other drugs such as carboplatin 11  and nedaplatin 8  are given, or treatment was changed to surgery or radiation therapy. 9 ,  12  However, we decided to continue BEP because of a case report of recurrence of SIADH even after switching from cisplatin to carboplatin, 8  and because cisplatin is probably superior to carboplatin for the treatment of metastatic germ cell tumors. 13  To the best of our knowledge, there is one case of hyponatremia induced by BEP described in the literature. That case was initially diagnosed with SIADH, but this was changed to RSWS which also causes hyponatremia because of the reabsorption failure of water and sodium due to tubular damage. 14  Differential diagnosis criteria for SIADH include renal dysfunction, dehydration, and loss of sodium exceeding intake (Table  1 ). 14  In the present case, there was no renal dysfunction or dehydration findings, so RSWS was not diagnosed. Serum sodium level was monitored by frequent blood tests after the second course of chemotherapy. Although urinary sodium excretion was increased and hyponatremia was observed during the second and third courses, serum sodium could be maintained at >130 mEq/L (Fig.  2 ). Hyponatremia induced by cisplatin occurs between several days and 1 week after drug administration in both SIADH and RSWS. 9 ,  12 ,  15  In the present case, the lowest value was observed on day 9 for all three courses (Fig.  2 ). The rate of hyponatremia and SIADH of any cause is reported to be approximately 4% and 1%, respectively, in hospitalized cancer patients. 16  Although SIADH occurs as a side effect of cisplatin in <0.1% of patients according to the product information insert, there have been dozens of reported cases of SIADH and RSWS as a side effect of chemotherapy in the past. 8 ,  9 ,  11 ,  12 ,  15 Differential diagnosis of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and the renal salt wasting syndrome SIADH is a serious adverse event of cisplatin‐containing chemotherapy. Continuation of cisplatin administration with precise electrolyte adjustment can nevertheless remain a treatment option in regimens where cisplatin is essential for the optimal antitumor effects."

One study suggested that testicular tumours may be more common in Asian than in Caucasian children [ 4 ]. Testicular cancer represents the most common malignancy in males aged 15-34 years [ 5 ]. Histopathologically, testicular germ cell tumours are divided into two major groups: pure seminoma and nonseminoma. The pathogenesis of testicular germ cell tumours remains unknown; however, although recently questioned [ 6 ], cryptorchidism is the main risk factor, and molecular studies have shown strong evidence of an association between genetic alterations and testicular germ cell tumours [ 7 ]. Nearly 40% of the cases correspond to seminomas, and three-quarters of them are diagnosed with stage I of the disease [ 5 ]. Although testicular cancer has excellent cure rates, the choice of treatment centre is of utmost importance. Expert centres achieve better results for both the early-stage testicular cancer (lower relapse rates) and overall survival (higher stages within clinical trials) [ 8 ]. Seminomas are more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy; therefore, they are easier to cure than non-seminomas. The surgical treatment is either orchiectomy or orchidectomy plus lymph node dissection of the involved ganglia followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Testicular cancer treated with neo adjuvant therapy was rare, due to the operable size of commonly found testicular cancer."

The overlying skin surface was presented with erythema, multiple abscesses and sinus tracts. The lesion was indurated and tender ( Figure 1 ).

        "content": "This case suggested neo adjuvant chemotherapy usage in inoperable testicular cancer. The patient was delayed in presentation due to limited access to appropriate medical facilities as well as the patient’s ignorance of the massive scrotal swelling that had been persisting for at least 12 months. In this case, the inoperable scrotal mass was then presented with multiple abscesses in the emergency room. Chest X-Ray Post Operation A review of the literature showed that this form of presentation is rare [ 9 ], [ 10 ], [ 11 ]. Although the recent diagnostic and therapeutic developments have altered the prognosis in this disease, the delay in diagnosis and occasional mismanagement of patients continue to inhibit further improvement in survival rate. A high index of suspicion and an aggressive approach to its management are advocated to improve long-term survival [ 12 ]. Testicular cancer has a higher responsiveness to chemotherapy compared to other cancer. The key to such success appears to lie in cancer’s stem cells, which are more sensitive to chemotherapy than stem cells found in other types of cancer. Defining why testicular cancers are so susceptible to chemotherapy could eventually provide insights for treating other, more resistant cancers [ 13 ]. Most types of tumours contain distinct populations of cells. A small fraction of these is stem cells, which can grow new tumours from a single cell and are extremely resistant to therapy. Often, other types of tumour cells are killed off during treatment, but cancer stem cells survive, then drive relapse by re-growing new tumours. However, when testicular cancer stem cells are exposed to chemotherapy, those stem cells are more sensitive to it than other cells in the tumour [ 14 ]. The use of neo adjuvant chemotherapy has led to a dramatic improvement in the cure rate of patients with metastatic germ cell tumours (GCTs). The high responsiveness of testicular cancer was achieved even in inoperable size of testicular cancer. After that, the goals of the patient changed from palliative into curative by the introduction of neo adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgical treatment and adjuvant chemotherapy. In conclusion, testicular cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is unusual as the mainstay treatment for testicular cancer is directly surgical and followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. This case presented the inoperable size of testicular cancer in which palliative chemotherapy takes place to reduce the growth rate of testicular cancer. However, due to the responsiveness of testicular cancer to chemotherapy agent, it reduced the initial size into an operable size, which later on able to follow the treatment stated in guidelines. This case report showed the possibility of using neo adjuvant chemotherapy as an alternative treatment when inoperable testicular cancer presented in hospital."

    "title": "Association Study Among Candidate Genetic Polymorphisms and Chemotherapy-Related Severe Toxicity in Testicular Cancer Patients",
    "abstract": "Testicular cancer is one of the most commonly occurring malignant tumors in young men with fourfold higher rate of incidence and threefold higher mortality rates in Chile than the average global rates. Surgery is the initial line of treatment for testicular cancers, and is generally followed by chemotherapy, usually with combinations of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP). However, the adverse effects of chemotherapy vary significantly among individuals; therefore, the present study explored the association of functionally significant allelic variations in genes related to the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of BEP and DNA repair enzymes with chemotherapy-induced toxicity in BEP-treated testicular cancer patients. We prospectively recruited 119 patients diagnosed with testicular cancer from 2010 to 2017. Genetic polymorphisms were analyzed using PCR and/or qPCR with  TaqMan ® probes. Toxicity was evaluated based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.03. After univariate analyses to define more relevant genetic variants ( p  < 0.2) and clinical conditions in relation to severe (III–IV) adverse drug reactions (ADRs), stepwise forward multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. As expected, the main severe ADRs associated with the non-genetic variables were hematological (neutropenia and leukopenia). Univariate statistical analyses revealed that patients with  ERCC2  rs13181 T/G and/or  CYP3A4  rs2740574 A/G genotypes are more likely to develop alopecia; patients with  ERCC2  rs238406 C/C genotype may develop leukopenia, and patients with  GSTT1 -null genotype could develop lymphocytopenia (III–IV). Patients with  ERCC2  rs1799793 A/A were at risk of developing severe anemia. The  BLMH  rs1050565 G/G genotype was found to be associated with pain, and the  GSTP1  G/G genotype was linked infection ( p  < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed an association between specific  ERCC1/2  genotypes and cumulative dose of BEP drugs with the appearance of severe leukopenia and/or febrile neutropenia. Grades III–IV vomiting, nausea, and alopecia could be partly explained by the presence of specific  ERCC1 /2,  MDR1 ,  GSTP1 , and  BLMH  genotypes ( p  < 0.05). Hence, we provide evidence for the usefulness of pharmacogenetics as a tool for predicting severe ADRs in testicular cancer patients treated with BEP chemotherapy.",

        "section_name": "Introduction",
        "content": "Testicular cancers are malignant cancers that mainly affect young men. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been routinely used as the standard therapy for the treatment of metastatic testicular cancers. The standard treatment scheme for patients with low-risk testicular cancers involves three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) or four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin. Patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease are routinely treated with up to four cycles of BEP or four cycles of etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin. Chemotherapy for rescuing the relapse of testicular cancers includes a standard dose of vinblastine, cisplatin and ifosfamide ( Pizzocaro et al., 1985 ;  Mezvrishvili and Managadze, 2006 ). However, chemotherapy represents a significant challenge in the day-to-day management of the patients, since the inter-individual variations in response to the chemotherapy drugs are a major cause of concern. A drug that is well-tolerated and causes a strong response in some patients could prove to be ineffective, toxic or cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in others; therefore, research is required to analyze the effects of genetic variations on the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of these drugs. Statistics indicate that 1 in 15 hospital admissions for testicular cancer in the United Kingdom was due to ADRs ( Pirmohamed et al., 2004 ), and adverse drug effects in hospitalized patients were identified to be the fifth leading cause of death in the United States ( Mancinelli et al., 2000 ). Other evidence suggests that the annual number of reported cases of adverse reactions is around two millions which has been reported to cost US $100 billion ( Ross et al., 2011 ). The antineoplastic drugs have often been shown to exhibit toxicity at therapeutic concentrations; therefore, ADRs are frequently observed during chemotherapy, which has reportedly increased the total medical costs by 1.9%, and the costs of medicines by 15% ( Huang and Ratain, 2009 ). Response to chemotherapy may be determined by gene polymorphisms, which eventually govern the metabolism of cytotoxic drugs. The allelic variants of genes related with pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics processes can alter the enzyme activity of the metabolic proteins leading to changes in drug metabolism ( Agundez, 2004 ;  Quiñones et al., 2017 ). Therefore, the response to chemotherapy in patients may be partly determined by gene polymorphisms involved in the metabolism of these cytotoxic drugs. Most of the chemotherapeutic drugs are metabolized by phase I polymorphic Cytochrome P450 enzymes, whose variant alleles commonly affect drug effectiveness and toxicity ( Kivistö et al., 1995 ;  Quiñones et al., 2008 ;  Božina et al., 2009 ;  Ingelman-Sundberg and Sim, 2010 ;  Deenen et al., 2011 ). Cytochrome P450 isoforms 3A4 and 3A5 (CYP3A4/5) play a role in etoposide metabolism ( Zhuo et al., 2004 ). The  CYP3A4 ∗ 1B  rs2740574 genotype is associated with an increased risk of leukemia following treatment with etoposide and teniposide. This variant has been reported to contribute to higher risk of secondary cancers ( Felix et al., 1998 ). Moreover, two studies have also suggested that  CYP3A4 ∗ 1B  is a risk factor allele for prostate cancer ( Keshava et al., 2004 ). On the other hand, polymorphisms in phase II enzymes have been reported to affect the resistance and adverse reactions to several chemotherapy regimens ( Jain et al., 2007 ;  Mazerska et al., 2016 ;  Marchewka et al., 2017 ). Previous reports have shown that Glutathione- S -transferases (GSTs) are associated with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy ( Roco et al., 2014 ;  Nissar et al., 2017 ).  GSTM1 -null and/or  GSTT1 -null genotypes are associated with the development of grades III–IV thrombocytopenia ( Cho et al., 2010 ) upon combined chemotherapy with rituximab and cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone or R-CHOP. Grade ≥ III toxicity and grade ≥ III neurotoxicity has been observed in children with medulloblastoma treated with cycles of cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine ( Barahmani et al., 2009 ). Besides, the  GSTP1  Ile105Val polymorphism has been strongly associated with progression-free survival. The T/T genotype of the −69 C > T  GSTA1  polymorphism correlates with overall survival. Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neuropathy were less frequent among patients with the  GSTM1 -null or  GSTM3  intron 6 AGG/AGG genotypes ( Khrunin et al., 2010 ). Moreover, the presence of UDP-Glucuronosyl-transferase Family 1 Member A1 ( UGT1A1 ) polymorphic variants has also been associated with chemotherapy response and Gilbert Syndrome after chemotherapy ( Ha et al., 2017 ;  Negoro et al., 2018 ). The most studied  UGT1A1  allele is  UGT1A1 ∗ 28 , which has mainly been associated with an increased risk of irinotecan toxicity ( Lyer et al., 2002 ). In line with this evidence, the FDA recommended tests to detect the presence of  UGT1A1 ∗ 28 , to predict patients at risk of irinotecan poisoning 1 . ABC-drug transporters are also implicated in the metabolic response to chemotherapy ( Domenichini et al., 2019 ). P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp1), also known as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) or ATP- binding cassette sub-family B member 1, is highly polymorphic and several studies have reported that carriers of the T-allele for the genetic variation  C3435T  (rs1045642) have an increased risk of colon, breast, and renal cancer ( Phuthong et al., 2017 ). However,  Cizmarikova et al. (2010) , found no significant differences in hematological toxicities in the groups with the  MDR1 C3435T  polymorphism in breast cancer. On the other hand, bleomycin (BLM) is metabolically inactivated by the action of cysteine peptidase bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) ( Schwartz et al., 1999 ;  Deenen et al., 2011 ).  de Haas et al. (2008) , showed that  BLMH  A/G genotype was related with reduced survival and higher prevalence of early relapses in testicular cancer patients. Recently,  Jóna et al. (2016) , showed lower rate of pulmonary complications in the A/A genotype group than those in the group containing the mutated allele: A/G+G/G in ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine)-treated Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Several antineoplastic drugs have been reported to cause DNA damage. Numerous studies have investigated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair enzymes, clinical outcomes, and resistance to chemotherapy ( Zamble and Lippard, 1995 ;  Gossage and Madhusudan, 2007 ;  Frosina, 2009 ;  Zhang et al., 2017 ) indicating that reduced activity of DNA repair enzymes may lead to an improved response to chemotherapy. However, compromised repair may also lead to accumulation of DNA damage in normal cells, leading to adverse side effects in normal tissues, thereby predisposing them toward secondary cancers. Due to these side effects, commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, including alkylating agents (cisplatin), inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II (etoposide), and BLM have proven to be toxic to the patients. Excision repair cross-complementary 1 (ERCC1) is a key protein involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), and ERCC1-Xeroderma pigmentosum (ERCC1-XPF) catalyzes the incision on the site of DNA damage ( Park et al., 1995 ). Elevated ERCC1 expression in cancers is associated with resistance to DNA damage-based chemotherapy ( Chiu et al., 2011 ;  Tsai et al., 2011 ). On the other hand, Xeroderma pigmentosum complementary group D ( XPD/ERCC2 ) encodes a helicase which participates in both NER and basal transcription as part of the transcription factor IIH. Mutations abolishing the enzymatic function of the ERCC2 protein are manifested clinically in combinations of three severe syndromes, including Xeroderma pigmentosum ( Lehmann, 2001 ;  Clarkson and Wood, 2005 ). Polymorphisms in these enzymes further affect DNA repair and are involved in resistance to chemotherapy, survival, and cancer manifestation ( Benhamou and Sarasin, 2002 ;  Giovannetti et al., 2011 ). Based on the accumulated scientific evidence about BEP chemotherapy, we here focused on functionally significant gene polymorphisms in proteins that control metabolism, uptake, and response to BEP drugs ( 2 Roco et al., 2014 ;  Chen et al., 2017 ). Mainly, the allelic variants of  CYP3A4  rs2740574  ( ∗ 1B) ,  CYP3A4  rs35599367  ( ∗ 22) ,  CYP3A5  rs776746  ( ∗ 3) ,  GSTM1 -null,  GSTP1  rs1695,  GSTT1 - null,  UGT1A1  rs8175347  ( ∗ 28) ,  BLMH  rs1050565 , ERCC1  rs11615 , ERCC1  rs3212986,  ERCC2  rs13181,  ERCC2  rs1799793,  ERCC2  rs238406, and  MDR1  rs1045642 were analyzed with non-genetic factors to validate their association with ADRs in testicular cancer patients treated with BEP schedule."

Chemotherapy regimen for all patients involved the administration of cisplatin and etoposide in combination with bleomycin for up to four cycles (BEP schedule), which is the standard treatment for patients with low or intermediate risk testicular cancers, all over the world ( Pizzocaro et al., 1985 ;  Mezvrishvili and Managadze, 2006 ). This regimen was applied in conjunction with a rigorous and standardized hydration regimen for all the patients.

        "section_name": "Discussion",
        "content": "Patient response to chemotherapy has been investigated for long, and ADR after chemotherapy is a substantial clinical problem. For testicular cancers, this is particularly relevant since besides surgery (inguinal orchiectomy) chemotherapy is routinely administered with combination of three cytostatic drugs, bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. Even though chemotherapy is quite successful in the treatment for patients with seminoma and the success rates exceed 90%, adverse reactions are frequently observed in response to one of the drugs or the drug combination. Therefore, in the present study, we have evaluated the role of genetic polymorphisms and other non-genetic factors as potential modifying risk factors for ADRs. In the univariate analyses ( Table 3 ), we found interesting association between  BLMH  rs1050565 G/G genotype and severe pain in patients (OR = 16.73, CI = 1.78–157.15,  p -value = 0.014). Our observation is in line with the report from White and coworkers who showed an association between acute chest pain and bleomycin infusion ( White et al., 1987 ). Considering that G allele of  BLMH  leads to the incorporation of 443Val in the enzyme, reducing its biochemical activity, this association supports our finding and high bleomycin plasma levels in patients can be expected. On the other hand, patients with  CYP3A4  rs2740574 A/G genotypes are more likely to develop alopecia (OR = 6.87, CI = 1.02–46.06,  p -value = 0.047). This gene encodes for the main enzyme involved in etoposide metabolism 2 , and metabolizes cisplatin or bleomycin. The presence of G allele leads to reduced transcription of the enzyme, suggesting a relationship between dose and increased plasma levels of etoposide and alopecia. Cisplatin mainly reacts with N-7 of guanine and adenine to form adducts with the DNA ( Kelland, 2007 ) resulting in the formation of intra and inter strands crosslinks, causing potential errors in DNA repair, resulting in accumulation of damaged DNA, and activation of apoptotic pathway in neoplastic and normal cells. Therefore, it was important to analyze both, the drug-metabolizing enzymes (GSTs) and the DNA damage repair proteins. We observed that  GSTT1 -null genotype is associated with lymphocytopenia (OR = 17.67, CI = 1.23–252.73,  p -value = 0.034) and  GSTP1  rs1695 G/G genotype is associated with increased infections (OR = 12.25, CI = 1.05–143.09,  p -value = 0.046). Similarly,  ERCC2  rs1799793 A/A genotype showed association with anemia (OR = 27.00, CI = 1.68–434.44,  p -value = 0.020),  ERCC2  rs238406 A/A genotype was associated with leukopenia (OR = 5.5, CI = 1.26–24.10,  p -value = 0.024) and  ERCC2  rs13181 T/G genotype was linked with alopecia (OR = 10.86, CI = 1.16–101.35,  p -value = 0.036), indicating that defects in the metabolism and/or the response to cisplatin could lead to the specific severe ADRs ( Table 3 ). This is in agreement with studies that report that G allele of  GSTP1  rs1695 has been associated with an increased risk of myelosuppression, polyneuropathy, and toxicity ( Joerger et al., 2012 ). Conversely, it has been found that the genotype  GSTP1  A/A is predicted to show a suboptimal response to chemotherapy with fluorouracil/cisplatin, and a lower survival rate in patients with advanced gastric cancer ( Ruzzo et al., 2006 ). Studies on  GSTM1  and  GSTT1  have shown that high expression levels of both enzymes result in a low response to chemotherapy, and deletion of these genes shows high degrees of toxicity ( Bai et al., 1996 ;  Ambrosone et al., 2001 ). In ovarian cancer patients, severe emesis grades III–IV were associated with  GSTT1 -null genotype ( Khrunin et al., 2010 ). In contrast, in patients with  GSTM1 -null genotype the risk of thrombocytopenia and anemia was lower ( Khrunin et al., 2010 ). For  GSTP1 , the G/G genotype seems to decrease the susceptibility to grade III neuropathy when compared to that in patients with A/G and/or A/A genotypes (recessive model of inheritance) in ovarian cancer ( Khrunin et al., 2010 ). In this study, however, we did not find an association of these polymorphic enzymes with the above-mentioned adverse reactions. However, the effect of GST in hematological toxicity is reasonable, since GSTs are responsible for etoposide breakdown and elimination 2 . The analysis of univariate associations among severe ADRs and non-genetic factors ( Table 4 ) showed an association between cumulative dose of bleomycin, bleomycin dose by average and bleomycin cycles by range; and that these parameters are associated with febrile neutropenia, as well as cisplatin dose by range. Similarly, cumulative dose of etoposide (total or by average) is associated with leukopenia as well as the cumulative dose of cisplatin. Besides, neutropenia is associated with both, cumulative or cumulative by average dose of cisplatin or etoposide. These results are consistent with the studies that report the relationship between hematological ADRs and BEP drugs, particularly etoposide and cisplatin 5 6 . Moreover, alopecia was significantly associated only with dose of bleomycin (cumulative and by average). Multivariate analyses to obtain risk association models of severe ADRs, including polymorphisms and non-genetic variables ( Table 5 ) yielded good models to partly explain febrile neutropenia (Pseudo R 2 : 0.0956), leukopenia (Pseudo R 2 : 0.1372), vomiting (Pseudo R 2 : 0.1231), nausea (Pseudo R 2 : 0.1278), and alopecia (Pseudo R 2 : 0.2135). Interestingly, in these models, only dosage but not the demographic variables were relevant for severe ADRs. For better understanding  Figure 1  shows a scheme of this research and relevant results. After recruitment, genotyping and data collection from patients, genetic and non-genetic factors were submitted to logistic univariate statistical analyses. Then, logistic multivariate models were adjusted using a stepwise forward procedure with a cut-off  p -value ≤ 0.2. The multivariate models are described by pseudo R 2  values and equations for the obtained significant ADRs association models (febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, vomiting, nausea, and alopecia). Scheme of this research and relevant results. BEP, bleomycin-etoposide-cisplatin therapy; ADRs, adverse drug reactions; TCa, testicular cancer. Despite our analysis, the study has some shortcomings. Although we had a relatively appropriate sample size for combinatorial analyses, fewer number of patients examined could mask potential associations, especially for low frequency polymorphisms, particularly in the multivariate analyses. Some other potentially candidate genes/polymorphisms were not evaluated in this study (based in level of evidence), which could be still relevant. Besides, the cumulative doses were obtained at the end of the therapy, which could limit our conclusions about this factor in relation to ADRs. We were not able to analyze additional potential toxicities such as hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity due to incomplete clinical data. These, and others missing clinical values, could be relevant, giving rise to a possible differential misclassification bias affecting estimated associations between potentially relevant combinations of risk factors and adverse reactions. Finally, we did not adjust  p -values for multiple tests (Bonferroni’s adjustment), which could generate direct implications in α and the  p -value. However, it has been proposed that the adjustment is not always recommended, especially when high number of comparison are performed and multiple false negatives need to be avoided, which is the case ( Goldman, 2008 ;  Kim and Bang, 2016 )."

Patients with  ERCC2  rs1799793 A/A genotype were at higher risk of developing anemia. Patients with  BLMH  rs1050565 G/G genotype experienced severe pain, and patients with  GSTP1  G/G genotype were susceptible to severe infections. As expected, severe ADRs associated with non-genetic variables were hematological (neutropenia and leukopenia). The multivariate analyses showed an association between specific  ERCC1/2  genotypes and cumulative dose of BEP drugs with the appearance of severe leukopenia and/or febrile neutropenia. Grades III–IV vomiting, nausea and alopecia could also be partly explained by the presence of specific  ERCC1 /2,  MDR1 ,  GSTP1 , and  BLMH  genotypes. Our study provides additional evidence for the use of pharmacogenetics as a useful tool for potential prediction of severe ADRs in testicular patients treated with BEP chemotherapy."

        "content": "Testicular cancer is a rare tumor which accounts for almost 1-5% of malignancies in men. Testicular germ cell cancers are the most common solid malignancy among young men at the age ranging between 14 and 35 years ( 1 ). The incidence of testis cancer has shown an increasing trend over the last 40 years with substantial differences among countries ( 2 ). Nonseminoma is the more aggressive type of testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) compared with the seminoma type, which comprises multiple cell types of embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma ( 3 ,  4 ). The treatment options for nonseminomatous GCTs after the radical orchiectomy include surveillance, chemotherapy, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), which will be decided following retroperitoneal and chest evaluations and repeated measurements of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serum tumor markers ( 5 ,  6 ). RPLND is usually the standard of care and first line therapy for post-chemotherapy non-seminoma patients with negative or plateau tumor marker levels and abnormal imaging findings (residual masses ≥ 1 cm) ( 7 ,  8 ). In these patients, there is a risk of existing mature teratoma and/or viable GCT, which indicates the necessity of post-chemotherapy RPLND to determine the extent of the spread of any malignant disease and to resect all the residual masses in the retroperitoneum. RPLND is a challenging surgery that should be done in high-volume centers and might be accompanied with adjunctive surgeries including nephrectomy and vascular surgery ( 9 ,  10 ). Complication rate of 7% -30% has been reported for post-chemotherapy RPLND including retrograde ejaculation, serious bleeding, and lymphatic leak ( 11 ,  12 ). Finding a less aggressive staging technique will reduce the morbidity and mortality rates accompanied with RPLND and might be able to avoid the unnecessary RPLNDs. Introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy as a less aggressive approach to lymph node dissection has replaced regional lymphatic evaluation in melanoma, breast, gynecological and urological malignancies ( 13 - 19 ). Sentinel lymph node as the first metastatic tumor landing site through lymphatic flow, can be detected using radiotracers or dyes ( 20 ,  21 ). The dissected sentinel lymph node reveals the pathologic status of other regional lymph nodes and there is a potential benefit of avoiding unnecessary lymph node dissection. Sentinel node mapping has also been evaluated in urological oncology. Although the feasibility and accuracy of sentinel lymph node mapping has actively been evaluated in prostate, penile, bladder, and renal cancers, few studies have considered the validity of this staging approach in testicular cancer patients at the time of orchiectomy ( 12 ,  15 ,  19 ,  22 ,  23 ). In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of sentinel lymph node mapping using intra-operative injection of radiotracer in non-seminomatous testicular cancer patients with history of orchiectomy who were candidate for RPLND in post-chemotherapy setting."

        "content": "In this pilot study, all patients with non-seminoma germ cell tumors who were candidate for post-chemotherapy RPLND at the urology department of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, from 2016 to 2019 were consecutively included. All patients gave their informed consent before entering the study. Totally 9 patients with nonseminoma germ cell tumors had indications for RPLND in the post chemotherapy setting, based on the CT imaging and serum tumor markers. All cases had the history of radical orchiectomy and chemo-therapy. In all the included patients, residual retroperitoneal masses ≥1 cm were present following systemic chemotherapy sessions and post chemotherapy serum tumor markers were at normal level, including Beta-HCG <3 ng/ml and Alpha-FP <10 ng/ml ( 24 ). This study was approved by the ethics committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences under the number of 940295. All patients gave an informed consent before entering the study. Radiotracer injection Under general anesthesia in the supine position and after exposing the peritoneum through transabdominal approach, 37 MBq (1 mCi) of technetium-99m-labelled phytate in 1 mL of saline was injected in two divided doses (0.5 mL each) in the stump of the spermatic cord ( Figure 1 ). Spermatic cord stump as the injection site of the radiotracer Intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes Following exposing the retroperitoneal space, ureter, testicular vein and main vessels were observed. A hand-held gamma probe (SURGEOGUIDE II, Parto Negar Persia Co.), was used for radio-guided retroperitoneal sentinel lymph node detection and confirming the location of the sentinel lymph nodes. The mean time between the injection of the radiotracer to measuring the radioactivity of the lymph nodes was 1.5 hours. Any node with the in vivo count rate, 10 times higher than the thigh count rate was considered as a potential sentinel node and was harvested. Any harvested node with ex vivo counts (30 seconds cumulative count) five times higher than the background (thigh) was considered as a true sentinel lymph node. Ex vivo count was measured by putting the nodes on the tip of the gamma probe and pointing the probe to the ceiling. This process was repeated until the instan-taneous count rate of the retroperitoneum became less than 10 times of the background. Lymphadenectomy In all patients full bilateral RPLND was performed ( 24 ). All the residual masses with the boundaries of the renal hilar vessels (superiorly), ureters (laterally), and common iliac arteries (inferiorly) as the dissection template, were dissected. The lymph node dissection spanned from renal hilar vessels to iliac vessels. Pathologic evaluation The pathologists examined the excised sentinel and regional lymph nodes to assess the precise pathological status of retroperitoneal lymph nodes. All dissected tissues were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and serially sectioned for hematoxylin-eosin staining. The histopatho-logical status of the sentinel nodes was compared with the other dissected lymph nodes. Detection rate and false negative rate The detection rate was measured as the ratio of all cases with at least one detected sentinel node to all included patients. The false-negative rate was measured as the ratio of patients with involved non-sentinel lymph node despite pathologically negative sentinel lymph node to all patients with involved nodes and at least one harvested sentinel node ( 21 ,  25 ,  26 )."

        "content": "In the current study, we evaluated the feasibility of sentinel node biopsy technique in post chemotherapy non-seminomatous testicular cancer patients who were candidate for RPLND. Due to rarity of the cases candidate for post-chemotherapy RPLND, only 9 patients with nonseminoma GCT could be included in our study. Thus far, only two other groups reported the feasibility of sentinel node mapping in testicular cancers ( 23 ,  27 ). Brief results of these two groups can be found in  Table 2 . Review of the previous studies In current study, at least one sentinel node could be harvested intraoperatively in 6 patients (amounts to 66% detection rate). In three out of nine included patients (with the disease stage of IIA-C) we had sentinel lymph node detection failure (33%); these three patients showed the presence of mature teratoma of germ cell origin in retroperitoneal lymph nodes, in pathological report. Several reasons have been proposed for sentinel lymph node detection failure including the methodological variations such as injection technique, and the obstruction of the lymphatic flow due to tumoral involvement of lymph nodes which inhibit the uptake of mapping tracer ( 22 ). The main reason for unidentified sentinel lymph nodes in our study was the presence of tumor cells in lymph nodes, which led to the obstruction of the lymphatic flow and inhibition of the radiotracer uptake in lymph nodes, and eventually no radioisotope count could be identified by gamma probe. Two previous investigating groups reported the feasibility of preoperative lymphoscinti-graphy and gamma probe guided laparoscopic RPLND in localizing and dissecting the sentinel nodes in patients with seminoma and nonseminoma testicular cancer candidate for orchiectomy. They injected the radiotracer into the testicular tissue around the tumor inside the testicular tunica albuginea one day before the surgery ( 23 ,  27 ). Unlike those studies, our study was performed in post-chemotherapy setting for candidates of full bilateral RPLND. The radiotracer was injected in stump of the spermatic cord at the day of surgery. The history of chemotherapy sessions was another reason of lower detection rate in our study as compared to the other reports. It has been also reported that previous chemotherapy could decrease the success of sentinel node mapping in breast, esophageal, cervical and bladder cancers ( 22 ,  28 ,  29 ). Intraoperative injection of the mapping material has been proven to be a feasible method for sentinel node mapping, as the movement of the tracer in the lymphatics is fairly rapid and successful sentinel node harvesting can be achieved by allowing a reasonable time between injection and harvesting of the sentinel nodes ( 30 - 32 ). Due to reported potential complications of blue dyes, we didn’t use the blue dyes in our study ( 20 ,  33 ). False negative rate is the main indicator of the sentinel lymph node mapping diagnostic value. In two out of five cases with metastatic retroperitoneal lymph nodes, sentinel node could be detected successfully which also confirmed the metastatic status of the lymph nodes (pathologically involved sentinel node in 2 cases). In three other patients with the presence of teratoma in dissected peritoneal lymph nodes, sentinel nodes could not be detected intraoperatively. Our results showed a false negative rate of 0% (0/2), which is a promising result. The study of Blok et al. also revealed the presence of micrometastases in three out of 25 evaluated patients through intraoperative gama probe-guided, extraperitoneal laparoscopic-RPLND; they also did not have any false negative detected sentinel lymph node with no nodal recurrence during the follow up ( 27 ). In the study of Satoh et al. three cases with stage I testicular cancer revealed micrometastasis in detected sentinel lymph nodes via gamma probe-guided extraperitoneal laparoscopic RPLND, and reported the incidence of nodal relapse in two cases with stage I seminoma (false negative rate of 40% (2/5)) ( 23 ). Satoh et al attributed the false negative cases to suboptimal technique of their study. They proposed that standardizing the sentinel lymph node detecting technique can reduce the incidence of false negative rate. To our knowledge, our study is the first on the feasibility of the sentinel node biopsy in patients with nonseminoma GCT who are candidate for RPLND in post-chemotherapy setting."

    "title": "Prediction of Nephrotoxicity Associated With Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy in Testicular Cancer Patients",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Cisplatin-based chemotherapy may induce nephrotoxicity. This study presents a random forest predictive model that identifies testicular cancer patients at risk of nephrotoxicity before treatment. Methods Clinical data and DNA from saliva samples were collected for 433 patients. These were genotyped on Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome-8 v1.2 (964 193 markers). Clinical and genomics-based random forest models generated a risk score for each individual to develop nephrotoxicity defined as a 20% drop in isotopic glomerular filtration rate during chemotherapy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was the primary measure to evaluate models. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were used to discuss model clinical utility. Results Of 433 patients assessed in this study, 26.8% developed nephrotoxicity after bleomycin-etoposide-cisplatin treatment. Genomic markers found to be associated with nephrotoxicity were located at  NAT1 ,  NAT2 , and the intergenic region of  CNTN6  and  CNTN4 . These, in addition to previously associated markers located at  ERCC1 ,  ERCC2 , and  SLC22A2 , were found to improve predictions in a clinical feature–trained random forest model. Using only clinical data for training the model, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.635 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.629 to 0.640) was obtained. Retraining the classifier by adding genomics markers increased performance to 0.731 (95% CI = 0.726 to 0.736) and 0.692 (95% CI = 0.688 to 0.696) on the holdout set. Conclusions A clinical and genomics-based machine learning algorithm improved the ability to identify patients at risk of nephrotoxicity compared with using clinical variables alone. Novel genetics associations with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity were found for  NAT1 ,  NAT2 ,  CNTN6 , and  CNTN4  that require replication in larger studies before application to clinical practice.",

Clinical features from 433 patients were originally extracted from hospital files as registered in the Danish Testicular Cancer database ( Table 1 ). In 2014, all patients with measurements of renal function before and after treatment with BEP were invited to deliver a saliva sample for DNA analysis ( Supplementary Figure 1 , available online). Patients provided informed consent, and the study was approved by the regional ethical committee (H-2-2012-044) and the National Board of Data Protection (2012-41-0751). Comparison of baseline characteristics between affected (GFR high-drop) and nonaffected patients  a BEP = bleomycin-etoposide-cisplatin; GFR = glomerular filtration rate; IQR = interquartile range. P  values were calculated by 2-sided Mann-Whitney  U  test for continuous or ordinal characteristics. For “histology,”  P  value was calculated by χ 2  test. All 433 patients received 3 cycles or more of BEP. The majority received normal-dose cisplatin 20 mg / m 2  × 5 q3w, etoposide 100 mg/m 2  × 5 q3w, and bleomycin 15 IU/m 2  q1w, and 25 patients received double-dose cisplatin and etoposide: cisplatin 40 mg / m 2  × 5 q3w, etoposide 200 mg/m 2  × 5 q3w, and bleomycin 15 IU/m 2  q1w. Hydration remained uniform over time with 2 L isotonic saline before cisplatin and an additional 1-2 L after. Diuretics were administered only in special cases, and no magnesium was added to hydration. There was no predefined cutoff of renal function where patients would not receive cisplatin-based triplets; however, to ensure toxicity was related to treatment, only patients with a GFR greater than 90 mL/min/1.73m 2  before chemotherapy were included. GFR was measured by the 1-sample 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid clearance technique using 2 samples 200 minutes after tracer injection and normalized to a body surface area (BSA) of 1.73 m 2 . Genomic DNA was collected and purified using GeneFiX Saliva DNA Midi Kit from Isohelix (Harrietsham, UK). DNA samples were prepared at DTU Multi-Assay Core (Lyngby, Denmark) and genotyped at AROS Applied Biotechnology A/S (Aarhus, Denmark) using Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome-8 v1.2 chip (964 193 markers). Genomic data were filtered using standard quality control steps ( Supplementary Figure 2 , available online). GWAS testing for single SNP association was conducted using PLINK ( 11 ) (v1.9beta3), with the GFR decline after chemotherapy as the measure of toxicity and discretized cisplatin dosage as covariate with double-dose and normal-dose groups. The cutoff of 5 cycles was made to differentiate between normal and historically higher doses of cisplatin. SNPs were annotated by ANNOVAR (v2015-06-17) ( 12 ) against the human reference genome hg19. Gene expression profiles were retrieved from GTExPortal ( 13 ). We used a suggestive  P  value threshold of 1 × 10 −5  ( 14 ) and a stringent threshold of 8.02 × 10 −8  [Bonferroni corrected ( 15 )]. In addition to the GWAS hits, 4 SNPs, rs11615 and rs3212986 ( ERCC1 ), rs13181 ( ERCC2 ), and rs316019 ( SLC22A2 ), found in previous literature to be associated with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity ( 9 ), were added to the input feature search space in the machine learning modeling. The clinical features used as input feature variables in the machine learning model were age at time of treatment, GFR before treatment, cumulative cisplatin dose per square meter of BSA, normal dose vs double-dose BEP, number of treatment cycles, histology (seminoma vs nonseminoma), prognostic classification as per IGCCCG ( 16 ) and stage of the disease as surrogate for size of retroperitoneal tumor size, which was represented as 3 features in the model (details on  Supplementary Methods , available online). A random forest model ( 17 ), which identified different risk subgroups of GFR drop, was developed using SciKit-learn ( 18 ) in Python (v3.7.1). A GFR decline of more than 20% after chemotherapy was chosen as outcome to indicate a clinically significant change and to avoid selection of cases due to random variation. A 20% decline has been associated with, for example, cognitive deterioration ( 19 ) and risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality compared with those with stable GFR ( 20 ). As a first stage, the predictive power of a model driven by clinical features only was established. In a second stage, genomic markers were added to the model. From all 433 individuals, about 20% (78 individuals: 20 nephrotoxicity affected) of the data, with no missing values, was randomly separated ahead of time to be used as a holdout set. Therefore, for machine model training, we omitted those 78 individuals present on the holdout set and excluded individuals with missing data in either clinical or genomic data ( Supplementary Figure 1 , available online). Patients’ baseline characteristics in each of these sets are available in  Supplementary Table 2  (available online). Training and testing of the algorithm was performed with a 5 outer, 2 inner fold nested cross-validation ( 21 , 22 ) ( Supplementary Figure 3 , available online). The sample-splitting process for training and testing cohorts was random and repeated 100 times. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was used as the primary performance measure for model optimization. A recursive backwards feature elimination approach was used for feature selection initiated with 10 clinical features and then reduced ( 23 ). To identify when the algorithm should stop removing features, a paired  t  test (level of statistical significance,  P  < .05) was calculated for each round of feature elimination on mean ROC-AUCs ( Figure 1, A and B ). A statistically significant AUC drop ( P  < .05) was indicative of an important feature being eliminated. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Details on model optimization and variable importance are described in the  Supplementary Methods  (available online). Feature selection using random forest-recursive feature elimination algorithm and diagnostic performances.  A  and  B ) Boxplots with different number of features, −10 to 1 and 27 to 5, for clinical and clinical plus genomics, respectively, and respective area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) throughout 100 different replications for data shuffling.  Asterisks  between boxplots represent  P  values (paired  t  test) of >.05 (*),  ≤ .05 (**), and  ≤ .01 (***). All tests were 2-sided. The  red arrow  represents the block chosen for further analysis.  C ) The features chosen the most on the 15-features clinical and SNP-based models.  D ) Performances obtained (mean and 95% confidence intervals) on the clinical models (6 features) and on the clinical and SNP-based models (15 features) using 0.50 cutoff for classification for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. NPV = negative predictive value; Perfs. = performances; PPV = positive predictive value; ROC-AUC = area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; SNP = single-nucleotide polymorphism. The top-ranked clinical features constituted the baseline for adding prioritized SNPs from GWAS (17 SNPs) and the literature (4 SNPs), and feature selection was done using recursive backwards feature elimination approach. We also calculated PRS-derived models weighted by effect sizes estimated by the GWAS using the R-Package PRSice ( 24 ). These were tested in the random forest models in place of individual SNPs. Two different approaches were used: the risks associated with all the 21 SNPs were combined to determine a PRS, and a PRS per gene was estimated. The primary reported performance was assessed with a 0.50 cutoff on the random forest model scores. In addition, to determine clinical applicability, we assessed different cutoffs on the random forest scores with a goal of 10% false discovery or omission rate (positive or negative predictive values >90%). For the SNPs and clinical-based models from the best round, the split that had a representative ROC-AUC close to the mean was used to assess different cutoffs ( 25 ) ( Supplementary Figure 4 , available online). Based on this, specific cutoffs for detection of 3 risk groups were used on the holdout set: a high-risk group for developing nephrotoxicity; a low-risk group for developing nephrotoxicity; and an intermediate group, which refers to individuals whose prediction is not adequately compelling to change the clinical decision."

        "content": "A random forest model ( 17 ), which identified different risk subgroups of GFR drop, was developed using SciKit-learn ( 18 ) in Python (v3.7.1). A GFR decline of more than 20% after chemotherapy was chosen as outcome to indicate a clinically significant change and to avoid selection of cases due to random variation. A 20% decline has been associated with, for example, cognitive deterioration ( 19 ) and risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality compared with those with stable GFR ( 20 ). As a first stage, the predictive power of a model driven by clinical features only was established. In a second stage, genomic markers were added to the model. From all 433 individuals, about 20% (78 individuals: 20 nephrotoxicity affected) of the data, with no missing values, was randomly separated ahead of time to be used as a holdout set. Therefore, for machine model training, we omitted those 78 individuals present on the holdout set and excluded individuals with missing data in either clinical or genomic data ( Supplementary Figure 1 , available online). Patients’ baseline characteristics in each of these sets are available in  Supplementary Table 2  (available online). Training and testing of the algorithm was performed with a 5 outer, 2 inner fold nested cross-validation ( 21 , 22 ) ( Supplementary Figure 3 , available online). The sample-splitting process for training and testing cohorts was random and repeated 100 times. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was used as the primary performance measure for model optimization. A recursive backwards feature elimination approach was used for feature selection initiated with 10 clinical features and then reduced ( 23 ). To identify when the algorithm should stop removing features, a paired  t  test (level of statistical significance,  P  < .05) was calculated for each round of feature elimination on mean ROC-AUCs ( Figure 1, A and B ). A statistically significant AUC drop ( P  < .05) was indicative of an important feature being eliminated. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Details on model optimization and variable importance are described in the  Supplementary Methods  (available online).

For the SNPs and clinical-based models from the best round, the split that had a representative ROC-AUC close to the mean was used to assess different cutoffs ( 25 ) ( Supplementary Figure 4 , available online). Based on this, specific cutoffs for detection of 3 risk groups were used on the holdout set: a high-risk group for developing nephrotoxicity; a low-risk group for developing nephrotoxicity; and an intermediate group, which refers to individuals whose prediction is not adequately compelling to change the clinical decision."

The majority received 3 or 4 cycles of BEP. Before treatment, the median (IQR) GFR (mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) was 128 (115-139) for affected and 119 (110-131) for nonaffected, and after treatment it decreased to 88 (75-99) for affected and 109 (100-119) for nonaffected ( Table 1 ). Of 433 saliva samples received, 8 failed to yield high-quality genetic data. After quality control filtering, a total of 411 patients and 623 289 SNPs were eligible for GWAS ( Supplementary Figures 1  and  2 , available online). There was no indication of population stratification or inflation in the quantile-quantile plot of observed vs expected -log 10  ( P  values) ( Supplementary Figure 5 , available online). GWAS controlling for cisplatin-based chemotherapy dosage identified 17 SNPs associated with GFR decline. Seven SNPs located contiguous on chromosome 14 within the intergenic region between  LINC00645  and  FOXG1  passed a genome-wide statistical significance threshold of  P  = 8.02 × 10 −8  ( Figure 2; Table 2 ). Nine additional SNPs located on chromosome 8, cytoband p22, passed a suggestive threshold of  P  = 1 × 10 −5  and were located in the intron and 3´ untranslated region of  NAT1  or the intergenic region between  NAT1  and  NAT2 .

Markers in a contiguous pattern that pass the suggestive threshold are marked with a  dotted box. These 17 SNPs were included in input feature space of the machine learning models. A baseline predictive model with only clinical features was trained using random forests. Of the initial 10 clinical features, 6 features were prioritized through recursive backwards elimination ( Figure 1A ): age at time of treatment, GFR before treatment, cumulative cisplatin-dose per square meter of BSA, number of treatment cycles, prognostic classification as per IGCCCG ( 1 ) 2  ( 16 ), and stage of the disease, excluding group and histology. Univariate analysis also highlighted features selected in the random forest model ( Table 1 ). A selection of genomic markers was added to the baseline clinical prediction model: 17 SNPs from the GWAS and 4 additional SNPs from prior literature. Through recursive backwards elimination, 15 features were prioritized (6 clinical and 9 SNPs). The selected SNPs were rs11615 and rs3212986 ( ERCC1 ), rs13181 ( ERCC2 ), rs4986993, rs15561, rs8190870 ( NAT1 ), rs1353035 ( NAT1/NAT2 ), rs316019 ( SLC22A2 ), and rs17038909 ( CNTN6/CNTN4 ) ( Figure 1, B and C ). None of the SNPs located within the intergenic region between  LINC00645  and  FOXG1  were selected.

Additionally, 2 PRS were added independently to the baseline clinical model but did not outperform the individual SNPs ( Supplementary Table 1 , available online). As a further validation, we tested for random outcome, simulated by permuting the labels 2000 times. This generated random performance for the model based on the clinical traits in combination with the 9 SNPs previously reported, with a ROC-AUC mean of 0.498 (95% CI = 0.497 to 0.500). Furthermore, to assess if the SNP selection was meaningful, the performance of 9 random GWAS SNPs instead of the previously described 9 selected SNPs was tested when combined with the selected clinical traits; this process was repeated 2000 times. This performed very similarly to clinical traits alone, with a ROC-AUC mean of 0.661 (95% CI = 0.660 to 0.661) against the model scores with a ROC-AUC mean of 0.742 (95% CI = 0.741 to 0.743) ( Figure 3 ).

        "content": "In this study, we were able to predict patients at risk of developing nephrotoxicity after BEP chemotherapy based on clinical and genetic features with a machine learning algorithm. Clinical features selected on the random forests–driven baseline clinical model were known risk factors of renal toxicity ( 2 ) and were statistically significant in univariate analysis. The aim of the baseline model was to mimic and codify clinical intuition, which relies on the available clinical information at the time of treatment. When genomic markers were added to the baseline model, prediction power substantially improved. We believe that genomic information, although not being predictive on its own, improves a baseline clinical model for identification of patients at risk for nephrotoxicity. PRS did not perform as well as independent SNPs when added to the model, suggesting that nonlinear correlations between SNPs drove the increase in performance opposed to the linear combination that PRS offer, as has also been suggested elsewhere ( 26 ). SNPs located in the  LINC00645  and  FOXG1  intergenic regions, although strongly associated in the GWAS ( P  = 5 × 10 −8 ), were not selected in the machine learning model because of either limited contribution or low minor allele frequencies ( Table 2 ) that made it harder to detect in cross-validated setups. Top GWAS hits and literature SNP hits for cisplatin-based nephrotoxicity in testicular cancer patients a Positions refer to assembly GRCh37. alt = alternative(s); CHR = chromosome; EUR = Europe; GWAS = genome-wide association study; MAF = minor allele frequency; ref = reference; ; SNP = single-nucleotide polymorphism; UTR = untranslated region. A linear model was adjusted for cisplatin dosage and scored by  P  values representing how likely the variant association was by random chance. SNPs rs4986993, rs15561, and rs8190870  (NAT1 ), rs1353035 ( NAT1/NAT2 ), and rs17038909 ( CNTN6/CNTN4 ) were newly discovered in the present GWAS to be associated with nephrotoxicity and added performance to the machine learning model. NAT1  and  NAT2  encode for arylamine  N -acetyltransferases that take part in metabolizing drugs and chemical compounds in humans with a role in folate metabolism ( 27 ). These 2 genes encode similar protein sequences [identity = 81.03%, Clustal-Omega, Uniprot ( 28 )], yet differ on expression profiles ( 13 ).  NAT1  is ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system, and  NAT2  is specifically expressed in the liver, colon, and small intestine ( Supplementary Figure 6 , available online). It has been reported that cisplatin can impair NAT1 by blocking its transferase activity in human breast cancer cells and impair murine Nat2 activity in cultured mouse tissues (liver and kidney) ( 29 ), which on one hand contributes to the therapeutic effects of cisplatin, but on the other hand may lead to accumulation of cisplatin in the kidneys. CNTN6  and  CNTN4  encode for contacting proteins, which mediate cell surface interactions during nervous system development and have been suggested to be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders ( 30–32 ), though the association with nephrotoxicity needs to be further explored. SNPs found previously to be associated with nephrotoxicity were incorporated in this model. These SNPs were located at  ERCC1 ,  ERCC2 , and  SLC22A2 . ERCC1  and  ERCC2  encode for excision repair proteins, and polymorphisms in  ERCC1 / 2  have been reported to alter ERCC1/2 DNA repair function ( 33–35 ), which may affect nephron repair capacity after cisplatin exposure during chemotherapy ( 36–39 ). If not adequately repaired, cisplatin-induced DNA damage can induce cell death ( 40 , 41 ). SLC22A2  encodes for organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) protein, which is expressed in the proximal tubule epithelial cells of the kidney and involved in the absorption and excretion of xenobiotics and metabolites ( 42 ). OCT2 efficiently mediates cisplatin cellular uptake, leading to high cisplatin accumulation in renal proximal tubule cells ( 43 ) where cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity typically occurs ( 44 ). OCT2 may be a key regulator in the renal accumulation of cisplatin, affecting drug handling and inducing nephrotoxicity ( 42 , 45 ). During primary treatment of disseminated testicular cancer, about one-third of the patients develop cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity ( 46 , 47 ). This clinical and genomics-based model could be used as an early assessment for nephrotoxicity risk, assisting in identifying patients at high and low nephrotoxicity risk and influencing decisions on cisplatin chemotherapy cycles. Using a 0.50 cutoff on the random forest model scores, we were able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.65, positive predictive value of 0.35, specificity of 0.60, and negative predictive value of 0.83. Differential thresholding of the nephrotoxicity model classified patients into high, low, and intermediate risk. For the high-risk group, the model correctly classified 67% of the patients who developed nephrotoxicity, yet only a small fraction of affected individuals was captured (0.06 sensitivity). On the other hand, for the low-risk group, the model correctly classified 92% of the patients who did not develop nephrotoxicity and captured 32% of the nonaffected population ( Figure 4B ). Even though the model shows utility in the ability to predict toxicity throughout the score range, extreme cutoffs to identify the highest and lowest risk patients could point at the least disruptive implementation of such a model within current practice. A strength of this study is the large dataset with a good representation of patients who developed nephrotoxicity after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, using exact renal measurements, and the first application, to our knowledge, of artificial intelligence on predicting such a phenotype. The machine learning models appeared to be robust with stable performance across 100 random cross-validation splits of the training data, demonstrating performance of 0.731 mean ROC-AUC in cross-validation and 0.692 (95% CI = 0.688 to 0.696) ROC-AUC in the holdout set. Yet, as a limitation, the machine learning setups use some of the association results from the GWAS on the same cohort; therefore, replication on another cohort from an external dataset would be of substantial interest.  NAT1  and  NAT2  appear as interesting genetic targets to prioritize for assaying in future nephrotoxicity studies and would benefit from functional validation. The ability to develop machine learning models for patient stratification in different nephrotoxicity risk groups has the potential to balance aggressive treatment against predicted toxicity risk. In the future, toxicity may play a larger role in guiding treatment across several complex diseases, where data-driven prediction models may aid in decision making. Some of the clinical features used in this model, such as age at the time of treatment and GFR before chemotherapy as well as some of the identified genomics markers, could be applicable to other tumors types. Cisplatin is one of the most compelling drugs used in cancer treatment, and nephrotoxicity is a well-known side effect from its use. Our model could be applicable to ovarian, bladder, and lung cancer, where more elderly patients are at risk of nephrotoxicity and early identification of toxicity risks (or lack thereof) may influence treatment aggression or increase monitoring for selected patients."

    "abstract": "Purpose To evaluate the perioperative morbidity of PC-RPLND in two intermediate volume centers and to identify predictors of high morbidity. Methods Retrospective analysis of 124 patients treated with open PC-RPLND at two tertiary referral centers between 2001 and 2018. Perioperative morbidity was determined by analyzing additional surgical procedures, intra-operative blood loss, and postoperative complications. Results An additional procedure was necessary for 33 patients (26.6%). The risk was higher in patients with IGCCCG intermediate/poor prognosis (OR 3.56; 95% CI 1.33–9.52) and residual tumor size > 5 cm (OR 3.53; 95% CI 1.39–8.93). Blood loss was higher in patients with IGCCCG intermediate/poor prognosis ( β =  0.177;  p =  0.029), large residual tumor ( β =  0.570;  p  < 0.001), an additional intervention ( β =  0.342;  p  < 0.001) and teratoma on retroperitoneal histology ( β =  − 0.19;  p =  0.014). Thirty-one patients had a postoperative complication Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥ 2 (25.0%). Complication risk was highest in patients undergoing an additional intervention (OR 3.46; 95% CI 1.03–11.60;  p =  0.044). Conclusions The rate of additional interventions in our series is comparable to what has been reported in high-volume centers. IGCCCG intermediate/poor prognosis patients with high-volume disease and patients undergoing an additional surgical procedure can be classified as high-risk patients.

        "content": "Post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) is an important component of the treatment of disseminated germ cell tumor (GCT) [ 1 – 4 ]. It is a technically challenging procedure and is associated with significant treatment-related morbidity [ 5 ,  6 ]. In up to 30% of procedures, an additional surgical intervention is necessary during the procedure (e.g. nephrectomy or vascular reconstruction) [ 5 ,  7 – 9 ]. However, the identification of patients that are at increased risk of an additional procedure is primarily based on preoperative imaging. Previous publications about the outcome of RPLND are mainly from high volume centers and these reports make the case for further centralization [ 10 – 12 ]. It is debatable whether these large series reflect the outcome of the procedure in general. After all, most patients are not treated in one of the leading centers of the world. For example, the median annual number of RPLNDs per urologist in the USA is only one [ 13 ]. Between 2003 and 2013, 75% of urologists performed just one RPLND, while three urologists logged 23% of all procedures. These findings are confirmed by Yu et al., who showed that 51.6% of RPLNDs in the USA were performed at hospitals with ≤ 2 procedures annually [ 14 ]. In their analysis of German hospital billing data covering 2006–2015, Groeben et al. found that 44% of RPLNDs were performed in a low volume center (< 4 cases annually) [ 15 ]. Although there was a modest trend towards centralization, still only 18% of all RPLNDs in 2015 were performed in a high volume institution (> 10 cases annually). Thus, although most publications about PC-RPLND concern the outcomes in high volume centers, the overall majority of patients are treated in a low volume center. In smaller countries, such as The Netherlands, the low incidence of testicular cancer prevents the establishment of very high volume centers. Since 2017, the quality standards of the Dutch urological society state that a center offering RPLND should perform at least ten procedures annually [ 16 ]. Although it has been shown that the overall complication risk of RPLND is significantly lower in hospitals with a higher volume [ 14 ], reports from low and intermediate volume centers are still scarce. These reports are important to give a true view of the morbidity of PC-RPLND. In the present study, we evaluate the perioperative morbidity of PC-RPLND in two intermediate volume centers. Our primary aim is to analyze whether the perioperative morbidity is comparable to what has been reported in the literature. Our secondary aim is to investigate whether there are any risk factors that can be used to better identify patients with a high risk of perioperative morbidity."

        "content": "We performed a retrospective analysis of the medical records of all patients who were treated with open PC-RPLND in two tertiary referral centers between 2001 and 2018. In both centers, surgery was indicated in case of retroperitoneal residual tumor > 1 cm after at least three cycles of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy (bleomycin, etosposide, cisplatin). All patients who were treated with open PC-RPLND for gonadal or extragonadal GCT between 2001 and 2018 were included in our analysis. Exclusion criteria were incomplete data, prior retroperitoneal radiotherapy, prior RPLND (re-do RPLND), elevated tumor markers at time of surgery (desperation RPLND) and a minimally-invasive procedure. Patients who were previously treated with salvage chemotherapy but had normal tumor markers at the time of surgery were also eligible for inclusion. Institutional review board approval was obtained from both centers. During the period covered by our analysis, patients with a small tumor (< 5 cm) that was not adjacent to the large vessels were mainly treated with a minimally-invasive procedure at the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NCI). These patients were excluded from the present analysis. All patients at the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) underwent a template-based RPLND. In case of a residual tumor < 5 cm in the primary landing zone, a modified template was applied. In right-sided modified template dissection, the right ureter and the aorta were the lateral and medial boundaries, respectively. The renal vein was the cranial boundary and the crossing of the ureter over the common iliac vessels was the caudal boundary. In left-sided dissection, the lateral, cranial and caudal boundaries were represented by the ureter, the renal vein, and the crossing of the ureter over the common iliac vessels, respectively. At the NCI, complete removal of the residual mass and all enlarged lymph nodes identified on imaging and during surgery were resected, but no template resection of clinically and radiologically unsuspicious lymph nodes was done. The tumor localization prior to chemotherapy was taken into account. An additional procedure was defined as any surgical intervention that was performed in the same surgical session as the PC-RPLND. Complications that occurred during the 30-day postoperative period were categorized according to the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications [ 17 ]. In the case of multiple complications in one patient, all complications were registered but only the highest grade was used for the statistical analysis of risk factors. The available abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans prior to chemotherapy and prior to surgery were re-analyzed by one of two independent radiologists (J.V. and J.U.). They measured the tumor mass in three dimensions (axial, coronal, and sagittal) and examined whether the additional interventions could be predicted on the basis of these scans. Variables significant at the  p  < 0.10 level in the univariate logistic regression analysis were considered for inclusion in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Multiple regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between intra-operative blood loss as a continuous variable and relevant predictor variables. We corrected for the type of surgery (template-based RPLND vs. residual mass resection [RMR]) and primary histology. All tests were two-tailed and  p  value < 0.05 was considered significant. SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp., USA) was used for statistical analysis."

Five surgeons had a volume of more than ten procedures and performed a combined total of 106 procedures. The remaining 16 procedures were divided among 6 surgeons. Seventy-two patients were treated with template-based surgery and 52 patients with residual mass resection. Fifteen patients (12.1%) had received salvage chemotherapy prior to surgery. The median residual tumor size was larger in the RMR group (6.1 cm), compared to the RPLND group (3.9 cm;  p =  0.010). Patients in the RMR group had more often International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) intermediate/poor prognosis (63.5%), compared to patients in the RPLND group (47.2%). A total of 33 patients (26.6%) required 46 additional surgical procedures (Table  1 ). Most common interventions were nephrectomy ( n =  9; 7.3%) and inferior vena cava (IVC) resection/reconstruction ( n =  8; 6.5%). Less common interventions were: partial bowel resection, renal artery resection (each  n =  3; 2.4%), partial liver resection ( n =  2; 1.6%), adrenalectomy, superior mesenteric artery reconstruction, and segmental ureter resection with ureteroureterostomy (each  n =  1, 0.8%). Assistance of a vascular surgeon was required in 20 cases (16.1%). An additional procedure was performed in 16/72 patients undergoing template RPLND (22.2%) and 17/52 patients undergoing residual mass resection (32.7%). In all, 29 of 46 additional interventions (63.0%) were performed to achieve an adequate resection and 17 interventions (37.0%) were the consequence of an intraoperative complication. These complications were lesions of the iliac artery ( n =  6), aorta ( n =  4), renal artery ( n =  3), renal vein ( n =  2), IVC ( n =  1) and superior mesenteric artery ( n =  1). The tumor was adjacent to the site of additional intervention in all cases, which suggests that a preoperative CT scan is sufficient to identify patients in whom an additional intervention is likely to be necessary. The necessity of an additional surgical procedure was significantly associated with IGCCCG intermediate/poor prognosis and residual tumor size > 5 cm (Table  2 ). Pure seminoma on primary histology and type of surgery were not significantly associated with an additional intervention. On multivariate analysis, intermediate/poor risk category (OR 3.56; 95% CI 1.33–9.52;  p =  0.011) and tumor size > 5 cm (OR 3.53; 95% CI 1.39–8.93;  p =  0.008) were significant predictors of an additional intervention. Taking only the 107 patients with NSGCT into account, tumor size > 5 cm was still a significant predictor (OR 3.38; 95% CI 1.23–9.27;  p =  0.018) but intermediate/poor prognosis became borderline insignificant (OR 2.72; 95% CI 0.93–7.97;  p =  0.068; Supplementary Table 1).

Retroperitoneal primary, type of surgery, teratoma on retroperitoneal histology, additional intervention, IGCCCG prognosis and residual tumor size were included in the model. IGCCCG intermediate/poor prognosis ( β =  0.177;  p =  0.029), residual tumor size ( β =  0.570;  p  < 0.001), necessity of an additional intervention ( β =  0.342;  p  < 0.001) and teratoma on retroperitoneal histology ( β =  − 0.190;  p =  0.014) were significantly correlated with blood loss (adjusted  R 2  = 0.438;  p  < 0.001). A total of 38 postoperative complications Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥ 2 were identified in 31 patients (25.0%; Supplementary Table 2). A reoperation (Grade 3b) was necessary in three patients (3.2%). One patient underwent a hemicolectomy for colon ischemia. Another patient had a perforation of the small intestine, which was repaired during explorative laparotomy. The third patient had metabolic instability with unknown cause for which he underwent explorative laparotomy without an additional intraoperative intervention. The risk of a severe complication (Grade ≥ 3) was higher in patients with an additional intervention (24.2%) compared to patients without an additional intervention (6.6%,  p =  0.011) and this was borderline significant when corrected for residual tumor size (OR 3.46; 95% CI 1.03–11.60;  p =  0.044; Supplementary Table 3). Tumor regression was not associated with an additional intervention or postoperative complication. Two patients (1.6%) died from a postoperative complication (Grade 5). One patient had IGCCCG poor prognosis and a 10 cm large residual tumor in the left para-aortal region. The day after surgery, he developed hematochezia but exploratory laparotomy showed no signs of intestinal ischemia. A week later, the patient became hemodynamically unstable and a bleeding of the left renal artery was diagnosed, which was sutured during a subsequent surgical procedure. Unfortunately, the patient developed necrotizing pancreatitis with abdominal bleeding of unknown origin and had to undergo seven more exploratory laparotomies with resection of necrotic tissue. One month after PC-RPLND, a new aortic bleeding developed, for which an endovascular stent was placed by a vascular surgeon. Twenty-three days later, however, the patient became hemodynamically unstable again and CT-imaging showed an aortic bleeding proximally to the stent. There were no more therapeutic options and the patient died the same day. The second patient had intermediate prognosis and a 25 cm large residual tumor. He had persistent chylous ascites for which he underwent multiple abdominal drainages. Forty-six days after surgery, a peritoneovenous shunt was placed. After 3 months, the leaking lymph vessels were ligated during laparotomy. During this procedure, the aorta had to be reconstructed by a vascular surgeon because of an intraoperative avulsion. After surgery, he developed an aortic bleeding of which he died. After a median follow-up of 60.2 months (IQR 28.0–93.8), 9 patients (7.3%) had disease recurrence or progression. This was a retroperitoneal relapse in five patients (4.0%; template 2/72 patients, RMR 3/52 patients). All retroperitoneal relapses were inside the surgical field, except for one patient in the RMR group. The patients with retroperitoneal relapse were treated with salvage chemotherapy ( n =  1), palliative chemotherapy ( n =  1), chemotherapy with radiotherapy ( n =  1) or surgery ( n =  2). The four patients with relapse outside the retroperitoneum were all treated with chemotherapy. One patient also received radiotherapy and another patient underwent pelvic node resection in addition to his chemotherapeutic treatment. Five patients (4.0%) died of the disease. Four of these had a retroperitoneal relapse and one had tumor recurrence in the peritoneum. The cause of death was unknown in two patients. Together with the two patients who died of a postoperative complication, nine patients in our cohort died. Follow-up was < 12 months in 14 patients. Among the remaining 110 patients, overall survival was 91.8% (template 93.9%; RMR 88.6%) and cancer-specific survival was 93.6% (template 95.5%; RMR 90.9%)."

        "content": "The rate of an additional intervention in our study is comparable to what has been reported in other series, which ranges between 13 and 38% [ 11 ,  12 ,  18 – 21 ]. As in our study, nephrectomy and IVC interventions are the most commonly performed additional procedures [ 7 ,  11 ,  12 ,  18 – 20 ]. Cary et al. reported the results of 755 patients of the Indiana University, which is one of the largest series to date [ 11 ]. From 2003 to 2011, the annual rate of additional procedures ranged between 17 and 30%. A nephrectomy was necessary in 7.3% of patients. In a series of 85 patients who were treated by a single surgeon between 2004 and 2010, 28 patients (33%) required adjuvant surgery [ 19 ]. This was a vascular procedure in 13 patients (15%) and a nephrectomy in 12 patients (14%). In a multicenter analysis of 339 PC-RPLNDs by the German Testicular Cancer Study Group, the rates of IVC intervention and nephrectomy were 10% and 9%, respectively [ 20 ]. The results from these institutional series are similar to what has been found in nationwide studies. Wells et al. evaluated audit data for all RPLNDs in the UK between March 2012 and February 2013 and found that the rates of synchronous nephrectomy and vascular reconstruction were 11.1% and 5%, respectively [ 22 ]. Not all RPLNDs were in the post-chemotherapy setting (72.2%), but only 5.6% of procedures were primary RPLNDs. Macleod et al. analyzed the insurance data of 206 patients undergoing PC-RPLND in the USA [ 23 ]. Overall, 19% of patients underwent an adjunctive procedure, of which nephrectomy (10%) and vascular reconstruction (8%) were the most common interventions. Thus, the rate of an additional intervention in our series is similar to what has been reported by large institutional series and nationwide cohort studies. Postoperative complication rates reported in the literature vary widely and are primarily based on single-center series. Several high volume centers have reported rates between 3 and 12% [ 6 ,  11 ,  12 ,  18 ,  24 ]. However, several population-based studies have found much higher complication rates than what has been reported in series from high volume institutions. The study by Wells et al. showed that in only 73.5% of all RPLNDs in the UK no complication was recorded [ 22 ]. In a nationwide sample of all RPLNDs in the USA between 2001 and 2008, the overall rate of complication was 24.8% [ 14 ]. According to a population-based analysis of all PC-RPLNDs in Norway and Sweden between 2007 and 2014, a complication occurred in 25% of patients treated with unilateral PC-RPLND and 45% of bilateral PC-RPLND [ 25 ]. A Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥ 3b complication occurred after 2.2% of unilateral procedures and 9.2% of bilateral procedures. This shows that the complication rate in our cohort is equal to what has been reported in nationwide cohort studies. Although based on only two cases, the rate of Grade 5 complications in our cohort (1.6%) is higher than what has been reported in comparative studies. In a series of 152 patients by Heidenreich et al., one patient (0.7%) died due to massive postoperative bleeding caused by an aorto-dueodenal fistula [ 18 ]. Fléchon et al. reported one death due to an intra-abdominal bleeding in a cohort of 151 patients (0.7%) [ 3 ]. Patient outcome after complex cancer surgery is correlated with hospital volume [ 26 ,  27 ]. For testicular malignancies specifically, the recent literature is scarce. Woldu et al. found an association between hospital volume and survival in patients with non-localized NSGCT [ 28 ]. The authors analyzed data from the National Cancer Database (USA) for patients treated for testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) in the years 2004–2014. Compared to the highest volume hospitals, the hazard ratios for overall mortality were 1.28, 1.45, 1.48, and 1.83 for high-intermediate, intermediate, low-intermediate, and low volume hospitals, respectively. For RPLND specifically, Yu et al. showed that the overall complication risk was significantly lower in hospitals with a higher volume [ 14 ]. This shows that the centralization of RPLND is important to improve patient outcome. Although the most optimal annual number of procedures has yet to be determined, the current cutoff value of ten procedures per year in The Netherlands is relatively low. Several reports have shown a strong association between residual tumor size and additional interventions, similar to our findings [ 7 ,  11 ,  20 ]. In the series by Cary et al., residual tumor size > 10 cm was the strongest predictor of an additional procedure (OR 7.2; 95% CI 2.6–19.5) [ 11 ]. In an earlier study by the same authors, 31.9% of patients with a residual tumor size > 10 cm had to undergo nephrectomy [ 7 ]. A recent study from the University Hospital of Dusseldorf found a higher rate of additional interventions in patients undergoing a bilateral PC-RPLND (43%), compared to a unilateral PC-RPLND (23%;  p =  0.006) [ 9 ]. Nephrectomy was indicated in 12% of bilateral procedures but only in 3% of unilateral procedures ( p =  0.03). This difference can be most likely attributed to the difference in tumor size, since the decision whether to perform a unilateral or bilateral procedure was based on the size and location of the residual tumor, with 5 cm as a cut-off value [ 9 ]. The correlation between IGCCCG intermediate/poor prognosis and an additional intervention has been described previously by Winter et al. [ 20 ]. The authors found that the probability of an IVC intervention increased with tumor size ≥ 5 cm and worse IGCCCG risk category. Our study shows that these risk factors also apply to non-vascular additional procedures. The association between pre-chemotherapy risk category and additional (vascular) procedures can be explained by the fact that IGCCCG prognosis group can be regarded as a measure of tumor burden. Another possibility is a more severe desmoplastic reaction in patients treated with more cycles of chemotherapy. In addition to these patient and tumor characteristics, the indication of an additional intervention is also dependent on the PC-RPLND setting. The risk of an additional procedure is higher in patients who were treated with salvage chemotherapy [ 29 ]. Since only 15/124 patients in our cohort were treated with salvage chemotherapy and this parameter was highly correlated with IGCCCG prognosis, we did not include this parameter in our analysis. Whether complete resection of all residual tumor outside the retroperitoneal nodes is always indicated is up for debate. Recent studies have shown that a more extensive resection does not always lead to a better outcome. Nini et al. reported on a series of 14 patients with nodal and bone involvement undergoing PC-RPLND with simultaneous partial or complete bone resection [ 30 ]. All four patients with vital cancer had disease progression, irrespective of the extent of the bone resection, and three out of four died. Among the six patients with teratoma, both patients that were treated with partial bone resection had disease progression and died, whereas the four treated with a complete resection have been cured. This suggests that a more extensive bone resection was only beneficial in patients with teratoma but not in patients with vital cancer [ 30 ]. This is in line with a study by Nestler et al., who analyzed the tumor histology in resected organs in a cohort of 235 patients undergoing PC-RPLND with an additional resection [ 31 ]. Most common interventions were nephrectomy ( n =  74), IVC resection ( n =  66) and partial liver resection ( n =  48). Histopathological analysis of the resected organs showed necrosis in 40% of patients, which implies that the additional resection was oncologically unnecessary in these cases. We have identified clinical predictors that are useful for the risk classification of PC-RPLND patients. Patients with intermediate or poor prognosis, high volume disease, or patients undergoing an additional surgical procedure can be classified as high-risk patients. Although a complete diagnostic workup is necessary for all patients, extra attention is warranted in high risk patients. Evaluation of possible tumor ingrowth in adjacent organs is of particular importance in these patients. All tumors were adjacent to the site of additional intervention in our series. This shows that a preoperative CT scan is sufficient to identify patients in which an additional intervention is necessary. Our study is subject to certain limitations. First, a substantial portion of patients was treated with RMR instead of template-based RPLND. RMR is not standard of care and may be associated with a higher risk of retroperitoneal relapse. Although we corrected for the type of surgery in our analysis, this makes our results less generalizable. Second, its retrospective nature can lead to bias and underreporting of perioperative morbidity. We believe that the underreporting of complications is low, as we only included complications Grade ≥ 2, which are generally well reported. Third, patients at the NCI who had small volume residual disease (< 5 cm) were not included in this study, since they were treated with a minimally-invasive procedure. This may have introduced selection bias and overestimated the relapse rate, mortality rate and rate of additional interventions and complications. It also prevents a solid comparison between both surgical approaches, since the patient cohorts differed significantly. Fourth, PC-RPLND is performed at a lower frequency in our centers, compared to other larger series. Both centers, however, are two of the largest centers for PC-RPLND in The Netherlands. In addition to the treatment of low volume disease with a minimally-invasive procedure, the low frequency of this procedure can be explained by the low number of TGCT patients in our country (~ 800 new TGCT patients annually). Nevertheless, the outcomes of this study could spur the discussion on further centralization of PC-RPLND. A key strength of our study is that a radiologist re-analyzed the CT scans prior to chemotherapy and surgery. This assured uniformity in the method of tumor measurement and calculation of tumor regression. Another strength was the long median follow-up (> 5 years) since almost all patients had their post-surgery follow-up at one of the participating centers."

To optimize outcome, extra attention to possible tumor ingrowth and precautionary measures (e.g. assistance from a vascular surgeon, postoperative stay at the intensive care unit) is warranted in these patients. The preoperative CT scan is sufficient to identify patients in which an additional intervention is necessary."

    "title": "Development of Fournier’s gangrene after chemotherapy for the recurrence of testicular cancer despite the absence of anorectal lesions: A case report",
    "abstract": "Background: Fournier’s gangrene usually occurs when a specific bacterium intrudes into soft tissue, causing a wound or tumor. We encountered a patient with Fournier’s gangrene due to severe myelosuppression after chemotherapy, despite the absence of an initial lesion on the anus and rectum. Case presentation: A 54-year-old man with a left testicular cancer recurrence had undergone chemotherapy. He had asymptomatic hepatitis and high hepatitis B virus DNA levels, which were normalized by administering tenofovir alafenamide fumarate. Twelve days after the start of chemotherapy, he complained of severe pain around the anus. The following day, he went into septic shock. Visual inspection showed dark purple skin discoloration on the left side of the anus. Laboratory data revealed severe neutropenia. Computed tomography showed a high density of soft tissue on the left side of the anus and gas bubbles in the left femoral ring. We diagnosed the patient with Fournier’s gangrene due to a severe immunosuppressive state resulting from chemotherapy. We emergently removed necrotic tissue to the fullest extent possible. However, because the patient was in severe sepsis status, careful management in the intensive care unit was required for 32 days. After the first emergency operation, we performed several additional excisions. Finally, 391 days after the initial surgery, the patient was discharged from our hospital. The tumor has not recurred, and he is under outpatient observation in the urology department. Conclusion: Fournier’s gangrene should be considered in patients who are in a severe myelosuppressive state due to chemotherapy, have normal hepatitis B virus DNA levels but high hepatitis B surface antigen after tenofovir administration, complain of severe pain in the perianal area, and have a dark purple skin discoloration around the anus, despite having no initial anorectal lesions.",

        "content": "Fournier’s gangrene is a necrotizing soft tissue infection that develops mainly in the anorectal or genitourinary region and spreads rapidly to the surrounding genital, perianal, and perineal areas. [ 1 ]  Fournier first described it in 1883. [ 2 ]  Fournier’s gangrene occurs when bacteria, including streptococci, staphylococci, clostridia, coliforms, corynebacteria, and  Bacteroides , [ 3 ]  invade soft tissue in a mono- or polymicrobial fashion through an entry point such as a wound (including surgical wounds) or tumor, resulting in soft tissue necrosis and septicemia. With regard to the anorectal region, this infection occurs when hemorrhoidal fistulae are present. [ 4 ]  Treatment may involve Thiersch operation for rectal prolapse, [ 5 ]  hemorrhoid treatment, [ 6 – 9 ]  or chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for patients with rectal cancer. [ 10 , 11 ]  Fournier’s gangrene is frequently accompanied by an underlying systemic disease, diabetes mellitus, and heavy alcohol consumption [ 12 , 13 ] ; other causes include leukemia [ 14 , 15 ]  and the human immunodeficiency virus. [ 16 , 17 ]  All these conditions can be considered immune-compromising. Necrosis is a life-threatening complication of soft tissue infection, with high morbidity and mortality (multiple organ failure). The mortality rate for Fournier’s gangrene is estimated at 16%. [ 3 ]  Therefore, prompt diagnosis, necrotic tissue removal, and careful systemic management are required when encountering such patients. We encountered a case of Fournier’s gangrene due to severe myelosuppression after chemotherapy, despite the absence of an anorectal lesion. We report the case here with some literature discussion."

        "content": "A 54-year-old man underwent a left high-level radical orchiectomy for left testicular cancer 2 years earlier. The cancer’s histological type was seminoma (pT1N0M0), and its clinical stage was I. It recurred in the left retroperitoneal cavity lymph node, and the urologist planned BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin) therapy. However, the patient was an asymptomatic hepatitis B carrier, and 5 months before chemotherapy, the hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV-DNA) was 6.7 log/mL (the normal range is < 1.3 log/mL). Therefore, the urologist administered tenofovir alafenamide fumarate. (At our hospital, the diagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis are handled by the gastroenterology department; they examined the patient and then instructed the urology department to prescribe the drug. The urology department prescribed this drug because we do not have a chemotherapy department, and each department administers chemotherapy and drugs to control the progression of fulminant hepatitis B.) The HBV-DNA decreased to < 1.3 log/mL 2 months before chemotherapy initiation. After normalizing the HBV-DNA, the patient was administered 170 mg of etoposide and 34 mg of cisplatin on days 1 to 5, and 30 mg of bleomycin on days 2 and 6. Twelve days after starting chemotherapy, he complained of severe pain around the anus. On the evening of the 13th day, he went into septic shock. On the 14th day, the urology department consulted our department (digestive surgery). Physical examination revealed that the left side of the patient’s anus had a dark purple discoloration (Fig.  1 ). A rectal examination using the index finger was performed, with no indication of hemorrhoids or neoplastic lesions. However, the patient complained of severe pain during the examination. Next, a rectal examination using a proctoscope was performed. The rectal mucosa from the upper border of the anal canal to approximately 4 cm deep was dark purple in the 3 to 7 o’clock direction. Laboratory data revealed severe leukopenia (90/μL; Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis [LRINEC] score = 2), thrombocytopenia (1 × 10 4 /μL; thrombocytopenia is not counted in the LRINEC score), and elevated C-reactive protein levels (31.01 mg/dL; LRINEC score = 4). Other data included hemoglobin (10.4 g/dL; LRINEC score = 2), sodium (135 mEq/L; LRINEC score = 0), and creatinine (109.6 μmol/L; LRINEC score = 0). The LRINEC score was calculated as ≥ 8 (since blood glucose levels were not measured), strongly suggesting necrotizing fasciitis. [ 18 ]  Computed tomography (CT) revealed an escalation of the fatty tissue density under the skin on the left side of the anus and gas bubbles in the left femoral ring (medial region of the femoral vein) (Fig.  2 ). The gross perianal findings on the day of diagnosis. The skin on the left side of the anus was discolored dark purple. The computed tomography findings on the day of diagnosis. (A) The density of the soft tissue on the left side of the anus was elevated (white arrow). (B) Gas bubbles were found in the left femoral ring (white arrowhead). Based on these findings, we diagnosed the patient with Fournier’s gangrene due to severe myelosuppression after chemotherapy. The causative organism was thought to have invaded through the anus or the rectum and reached the left femoral ring through the left obturator foramen because gas bubbles were observed in the left femoral ring. An emergency surgery was performed. We removed discolored skin and necrotic fatty tissue (slightly brownish compared with normal fatty tissue), and minor bleeding from under the skin was observed after the removal. Subsequently, the abdomen was opened for the removal of the left femoral ring’s necrotic tissue and the left obturator foramen’s fatty tissue, where the causative organism may have passed to the left femoral ring. The skin on the medial side of the left thigh, which was salmon pink preoperatively, was discolored dark purple, as was the skin on the left side of the anus. Therefore, the discolored skin and fatty tissue were excised (Fig.  3 ). A necrotic specimen obtained during surgery was submitted for bacterial culture, and  Escherichia coli  was detected. Postoperatively, the patient was managed with a ventilator and catecholamine administration in the intensive care unit (ICU). The gross findings of the operative wounds on postoperative day 4. (A) The necrotic skin and the subcutaneous tissue on the left side of the anus were removed. (B) Laparotomy, removal of the left obturator foramen, and cavity drainage were performed. (C) The skin on the medial side of the left thigh was removed due to necrosis occurring during the operation. Dialysis was initiated the day after surgery due to multiple organ failures caused by sepsis. The neutropenia improved post-operation; however, additional resection of necrotic tissue and transverse loop colostomy were performed on day 4 because of continued acute circulatory failure, elevated lactic acid level, and stool adhering to the wound periphery. As the anus was almost necrotic, it was resected, and the remnant rectum was sutured closed. No tumors, hemorrhoids, or anal fistulae were observed in the resected specimen (Fig.  4 ). Gross findings of the resected specimen on the day of the surgery. No apparent tumor, hemorrhoidal fistula, or other soft tissue entry point was observed. Following this second surgery, the patient’s general condition and respiratory status gradually improved, and new necrotic tissue was resected in the hospital room upon detection (debridement was performed 6 times in the ICU). The patient was weaned from the ventilator 23 days after the initial surgery, discharged from the ICU 32 days later (Fig.  5 ), and completed dialysis after 49 days. After the wound had settled to some extent, the dermatology department performed a skin graft. The sutured and closed rectum was eventually opened, exuding a small amount of mucus; however, the surrounding skin had no mucus adhesions. We explained to the patient that if the mucosa was severely irritated, the solution was to remove the anal side of the intestinal stoma, although the operation involved some risks. The patient chose not to have the surgery because he was not particularly troubled by his current situation and the risks involved. We decided to follow up with the patient in the present condition. Finally, 391 days after the initial surgery, the patient was discharged from our hospital. Timeline from the first day of chemotherapy to the intensive care unit discharge. After chemotherapy, significant myelosuppression was observed; on day 14, tachycardia and hypotension were noted. The pulse and blood pressure stabilized after a second surgery on day 19. BT=body temperature, BP=blood pressure, CMZ=cefmetazole, CTRX=ceftriaxone, DOXY=doxycycline, G-CSF=granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, HR=heart rate, MCZ=miconazole, MEPM=meropenem, VCM=vancomycin. After the operation for Fournier’s gangrene, we performed CT several times to assess the abdomen and pelvis postoperatively. The recurrent lymph node was 15 × 13 mm before chemotherapy, 12 × 11 mm 12 days after chemotherapy initiation (the day we diagnosed the patient with Fournier’s gangrene), and 7 × 6 mm 72 days after the first operation. Subsequently, the lymph node returned to its normal size, approximately 7 × 4 mm. We also checked the alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels as tumor markers. Those markers were in the normal range before chemotherapy and did not change. For 2 years after discharge from our hospital, the lymph node size and tumor markers were assessed every 4 months in the urology outpatient clinic and every 6 months thereafter. To date, the tumor has not recurred."

        "content": "This case’s histological type was seminoma (pT1N0M0), and the clinical stage was I. The 5-year survival rate for patients with clinical stage I testicular cancer is 99%. [ 19 ]  The following 3 alternative therapeutic strategies exist for patients with clinical stage I seminoma after a radical orchiectomy: observation, adjuvant radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. [ 19 – 22 ]  The recurrence rate for observation is 13–20% [ 19 – 24 ] ; 6.6% of cases will recur > 6 years after the initial operation, [ 21 ]  and recurrence is possible even > 10 years later. However, if the disease relapses, it can be cured almost completely by starting chemotherapy at that point. The recurrence rate for adjuvant radiation therapy is < 5%, [ 25 ]  although this treatment is associated with several adverse events, including secondary cancer [ 26 ]  and infertility. [ 27 ]  The recurrence rate for adjuvant chemotherapy is similar to that for adjuvant radiation therapy. [ 25 ]  However, it is unclear whether complications in long-term follow-up, such as secondary cancer or cardiovascular disorders, will increase. Consequently, each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Nonetheless, as the final disease-specific or overall survival rates do not differ, European guidelines consider observation the first choice. [ 19 , 28 ] BEP therapy is the standard first-line chemotherapy for advanced testicular tumors. [ 29 ]  Three courses of BEP therapy are recommended if the tumor is in the good prognosis group, following the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification. [ 30 – 32 ]  In contrast, for patients with intermediate or poor prognoses, 4 courses of BEP therapy are recommended as standard treatment. [ 29 ]  Our patient was classified in the good prognosis group because he had a seminoma, no evidence of metastasis to other organs, and normal alpha-fetoprotein during the primary tumor’s resection. [ 30 ]  However, Fournier’s gangrene occurred during this patient’s first course of BEP therapy, which was subsequently discontinued. Nevertheless, as there has been no recurrence, the patient remains in follow-up. In this case, the leukopenia after chemotherapy was so significant that necrotic areas spread rapidly. Fournier’s gangrene is a deadly disease with a reported mortality rate of 16%, [ 3 ]  which should be treated immediately after onset. Therefore, early diagnosis is vital, and the LRINEC score has been established for this purpose. The LRINEC score uses blood and biochemical test data to predict whether a patient has necrotizing fasciitis. A score ≥ 6 indicates a suspicion of necrotizing fasciitis, whereas a score ≥ 8 indicates a strong suspicion of necrotizing fasciitis. [ 18 ]  This case’s LRINEC score was ≥ 8, which was strongly indicative of Fournier’s gangrene. If a patient is diagnosed with Fournier’s gangrene, the Fournier’s gangrene severity index (FGSI) [ 1 ]  and Uldag FGSI [ 33 ]  are tools for estimating mortality based on body temperature, heart rate, other systemic conditions, and blood test data. In this case, the scores were 11 and 17, respectively, indicating a mortality rate of 75% for FGSI ≥ 10 points and 94% for Uldag FGSI ≥ 10 points. The mortality rate of Fournier’s gangrene is also affected by the time from onset to treatment. The mortality rate for cases where surgery is performed within 12 hours of onset is 10%, compared with 50% for those treated more than 12 hours after onset. [ 34 ]  In this case, surgery was performed > 50 hours after the onset of significant anal pain. Consequently, this case was considered to be life-threatening. For Fournier’s gangrene, infection source control is the primary objective, along with broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, aggressive and repeated surgical debridement, and intensive management. [ 35 ]  The guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America state that empiric antibiotic therapy should be broad-spectrum (vancomycin or linezolid plus piperacillin/tazobactam or carbapenem or ceftriaxone and metronidazole) because the etiology is polymicrobial (mixed aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms) or monomicrobial (group A streptococci, community-acquired methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus ). [ 36 ]  In addition, the spectrum of antimicrobials should be customized based on the blood or tissue culture test results. [ 36 ]  For this patient, we administered meropenem and vancomycin, subsequently changing from vancomycin to cubicin because of impending renal failure. We de-escalated to ceftriaxone when  E coli  was detected in the tissue culture. Regarding surgical debridement for a patient with Fournier’s gangrene, the necrotic tissue should be removed as soon as possible. [ 37 ]  If sufficient time has not elapsed since the tissue necrosed, determining the extent of resection is difficult because of the lack of color change. In such cases, necrotic tissue should be excised until the bleeding site is exposed. [ 38 ]  The wound should be carefully monitored postoperatively, and additional resections should be performed if necrotic areas remain or emerge. After the necrotic areas are entirely removed, skin grafting, [ 39 , 40 ]  negative pressure wound therapy (also known as vacuum-assisted closure therapy), [ 41 , 42 ]  and hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be performed to epithelialize the wound. Negative pressure wound therapy can remove tissue exudate, reduce local edema, enhance neovascularization, and improve the tissue’s natural self-healing. [ 43 , 44 ]  Conversely, hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves tissue perfusion, promotes angiogenesis and fibroblast proliferation, and increases collagen synthesis and oxygen levels in tissues. [ 45 ] Four major questions can be raised in this case. The first question is whether the patient had Fournier’s gangrene due to myelosuppression after chemotherapy, as we have argued, or whether Fournier’s gangrene developed first, followed by sepsis and then leukocyte depletion. However, we could not identify a gateway for bacterial entry, such as a tumor or wound in the anorectal region. Furthermore, if sepsis occurred after Fournier’s gangrene, in this case, the bacteria would have to reach the soft tissues before strong myelosuppression appeared; however, it would be impossible for the bacteria to pass through the immune barrier of the intestinal tract without tumors or other lesions. Moreover, if sepsis occurred first, fever and tachycardia would have been present before the onset of grade 3 myelosuppression (12 days after the first day of chemotherapy). Therefore, in this case, leukopenia does not appear to have resulted from sepsis. Conversely, post-chemotherapy myelosuppression generally begins 7 to 10 days after the initiation of chemotherapy and is at its lowest 10 to 14 days later. In this case, grade 3 leukopenia occurred 12 days after the onset of chemotherapy, and grade 4 leukopenia occurred 14 days after chemotherapy. After the emergence of severe myelosuppression, the patient had shock symptoms such as tachycardia and hypotension. Therefore, we concluded that chemotherapy-induced leukopenia caused Fournier’s gangrene. The second question is how the bacteria reached the soft tissues. Cisplatin has been shown to rarely cause gastrointestinal ulceration or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract as an adverse event, which may be a gateway for bacterial invasion. However, in this case, no obvious rectal ulcers or perforations were observed in the resection specimen. In addition, the CT scan showed gas in the left medial femoral ring, although it was far away from the rectum. No gas or abscess was noted between the gases in the left medial femoral ring and the rectum. Therefore, we hypothesized that bacteria entered from the lower rectum; however, because the rectal wall is covered with rectal proper fascia and the surrounding area contains parietal pelvis fascia, adipose tissue, and lymphatic tissue, if a perforation of the anorectum had occurred, abscesses and gas would be expected to first accumulate around the rectum. Gas would present from the rectum to the left femoral ring in a connected or sporadic manner, especially as > 50 hours had passed between disease onset and surgery. Thus, the most likely situation is that the gas or abscess would accumulate around the rectum and progress to the medial side of the femoral ring. However, during surgery, we removed as much tissue as possible between the rectum and the gas reservoir inside the left femoral ring, where the bacteria could have passed, and no abscess was observed, as would occur with gastrointestinal tract perforation. Therefore, the possibility that Fournier’s gangrene was caused by perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, an adverse event caused by cisplatin, can almost be ruled out. Perianal abscess is another disease that presents with perianal pain and shows a hyper-absorbable area around the anus on CT, which should be differentiated. Perianal abscess is a disease where the anal glands become infected with bacteria and form abscesses. However, with this condition, the skin tone is unchanged or accompanied by redness, and fluid pus accumulates in the soft tissue. In this case, the severe leukopenia caused by chemotherapy may have allowed bacteria to invade through the anal glands, which would usually be prevented. However, this case differs from typical cases of Fournier’s gangrene because no initial injury or lesion was found, especially in the anorectal region. The third question is whether myelosuppression caused by chemotherapy was the only cause of Fournier’s gangrene. This patient was an asymptomatic carrier of hepatitis B. When chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive drugs are administered to such patients, nucleic acid analogs such as tenofovir should be administered prophylactically to prevent the reactivation of HBV and the development of fulminant hepatitis. In this case, the amount of HBV-DNA before chemotherapy reached the target level by quantitative testing, and indeed, fulminant hepatitis did not occur after chemotherapy. However, the hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen was 1581.56 IU/mL (the normal range is < 0.05 IU/mL). The HBV has been shown to suppress neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release by modulating reactive oxygen species production and autophagy. [ 46 ]  These NETs are extracellular fibrous structures comprising chromatin, histones, neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, cathepsin G, proteinase 3, and other complement proteins that bind and kill various microbes by exposing them to high concentrations of NET-related microbicidal factors, thereby preventing microbial spread. Therefore, the normal level of HBV-DNA with the high HBs antigen level did not necessarily indicate low levels of HBV itself, which may have suppressed the release of NETs from neutrophils and weakened their resistance to the bacteria. The fourth question is whether this case is pseudo-gas gangrene or not. CT images of pseudo-gas gangrene show gas in the soft tissues, resembling necrotizing fasciitis. However, the gas is not generated by gas-producing bacteria. The gas is caused by the rectovaginal fistula [ 47 ]  or gastrointestinal perforation (due to irradiation after the resection of rectal cancer [ 48 ]  and ulcer, [ 49 ]  among others), which allows gas in the gastrointestinal tract to enter the soft tissue through the perforation or by trauma, [ 50 , 51 ]  which can allow air from outside the body to penetrate the soft tissue. When this patient visited our department for consultation, we conducted a rectal examination and proctoscopy and found no obvious rectal perforation or ulcer. Additionally, the patient had no history of irradiation of the abdomen. Therefore, it is unlikely that gas in the gastrointestinal tract entered the soft tissues. However, when this case was diagnosed as Fournier’s gangrene and emergency surgery was performed, the skin color of the left inguinal region changed to dark purple, and necrosis had begun to appear, suggesting that gas-producing bacteria had reached this region. Based on the above information, this case is considered to be a case of Fournier’s gangrene rather than pseudo-gas gangrene. A PubMed search using the keywords “cancer chemotherapy” and “Fournier’s gangrene” yielded 23 cases. There were 16 cases of cancer chemotherapy purely associated with the development of Fournier’s gangrene. [ 10 , 11 , 52 – 62 ]  Among them, bacteria invaded the soft tissue from the rectum in 10 cases. [ 10 , 11 , 52 – 56 , 60 , 61 ]  Nine cases had rectal cancer, [ 10 , 11 , 52 – 55 , 60 , 61 ]  and the remaining 1 developed Fournier’s gangrene after bevacizumab was used to treat resected colorectal cancer. [ 56 ]  Bevacizumab was also used in 4 of the 9 rectal cancer-bearing cases mentioned above. Bevacizumab may cause the formation of microthrombi in the arteries, which may be the cause of Fournier’s gangrene. Bevacizumab is frequently used as chemotherapy for rectal cancer; however, it is necessary to be extremely cautious about the development of Fournier’s gangrene. Indeed, the above 10 cases were different from the report of marked leukopenia after chemotherapy, causing Fournier’s gangrene. Of the remaining 6 cases, 1 had Fournier’s gangrene of the scrotum and penis during chemotherapy for gastric cancer. [ 62 ]  The other 1 developed perforation of the small intestine after chemotherapy, including bevacizumab, for local recurrence in the pelvis and metastasis in the periaortic lymph nodes after rectal cancer surgery. [ 57 ]  Therefore, the above 2 cases are different from ours. The remaining 4 cases were all patients with hematologic malignancies. [ 58 , 59 ]  These patients underwent chemotherapy and experienced severe myelosuppression, which was followed by Fournier’s gangrene. These 4 cases are relatively similar to the present case, except that the portal of entry for the bacteria was the genitourinary tract in 3 cases [ 58 , 59 ]  and a laceration wound outside the anus in 1 case. [ 58 ]  The urogenital organs were thought to be the entry point for the bacteria in these 3 cases because in 2 cases, ulcers appeared on the scrotum before Fournier’s gangrene developed, [ 58 ]  and in the other case, edema appeared on the scrotum. [ 59 ]  The organisms responsible for the infection were also different:  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in the above 4 cases and  E. coli  in the present case. Based on the above information, there have been no reports of cases similar to ours. The anorectal region, which is constantly exposed to bacteria, is a strong barrier; therefore, it is almost impossible for bacteria to penetrate without a lesion. Indeed, we found no report of a case similar to the one presented here. In this case, the immune barrier of the rectal mucosa or anal canal epithelium likely became dysfunctional due to severe leukopenia caused by chemotherapy and the HBV-mediated suppression of NET release. Thus, the bacteria invaded the soft tissues and caused Fournier’s gangrene, despite the absence of any lesions in the rectum or anus. This study had some limitations. First, the absence of glucose measurements for Fournier’s gangrene diagnosis. This was because we did not know glucose was included in the LRINEC score when ordering the blood test. In the future, all test items included in the LRINEC score should be ordered to make a prompt diagnosis. Second, we found no lesions that could serve as a gateway for bacterial entry. Invasion through the anal glands remains a possibility, although if this were the case, a perianal abscess should have been present. Regardless, the leukopenia caused by chemotherapy would have allowed the bacteria to invade through the anal glands, making this case extremely rare. The patient understood and was comfortable with the treatment he received. After a colostomy was created, the patient had a mucous fistula in the area where the anus used to be; however, the amount of mucus coming out of the fistula was small and did not significantly interfere with the patient’s daily life."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) is the most curable solid tumor and most common cancer among men 18-39 years. While cisplatin-based chemotherapy has significantly lengthened the survival of patients with TGCT, it is associated with a high rate of thromboembolic events (TEE). AIM To summarize our single-center experience highlighting patients who were diagnosed with TGCT and received platinum-based chemotherapy, with special attention to those patients who suffered a TEE. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the medical records and imaging studies of 68 consecutive individuals who were diagnosed with TGCT and received platinum-based chemotherapy at our Institution in a metropolitan community between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019. RESULTS A total of 19 (28%) patients experienced a TEE following orchiectomy which occurred during chemotherapy in 13 (68%) of these patients. Patients with a higher pathologic stage (stage III) were significantly ( P  = 0.023) more likely to experience a TEE compared to patients who had a lower stage. Additionally, patients who were treated with 3 cycles of bleomycine, etoposide, and cisplatin and 1 cycle of etoposide and cisplatin or 4 cycles of etoposide and cisplatin were significantly 5 ( P  = 0.02) times more likely to experience a TEE compared to patients who were treated with only 3 cycles of bleomycine, etoposide, and cisplatin. CONCLUSION Due to numerous factors that predispose to a TEE such as large retroperitoneal disease, higher clinical stage, greater number of chemotherapy cycle, central venous catheter, cigarette smoking, and possible cannabis use, high-risk ambulatory patients with TGCT treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy may benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation. Randomized studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prophylactic anticoagulants are warranted in this young patient population generally devoid of medical co-morbidities.",

        "content": "According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 9610 new cases of testicular cancer will be diagnosed in 2020 with 440 deaths[ 1 ]. One in every 250 males will develop testicular cancer during their lifetime[ 1 , 2 ]. With the emergence of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the 1970’s[ 3 ], patients with testicular cancer are able to attain a 5-year survival rate of more than 95%[ 1 , 4 , 5 ]. However, the risk of a thromboembolic event (TEE) poses a significant concern in this population who are usually young- and middle-aged adults without medical co-morbidities. Several factors predispose to experiencing a TEE in the testicular oncologic setting including bulky retroperitoneal disease leading to vascular compression and stasis, endothelial damage resulting from vascular invasion, platinum-based chemotherapy with cisplatin and bleomycin that causes alterations of the clotting system, cigarette smoking, stress, central venous catheter (CVCs), presence of the germ cell tumor marker bhCG that predisposes to thrombosis, and recent surgery that enhances inflammation and disrupts thrombotic and hemostatic pathways[ 6 - 11 ]. The standard chemotherapy regimen is 3 cycles of bleomycine, etoposide, cisplatin (BEP) or 4 cycles etoposide, cisplatin (EP) for good-risk testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT), or 4 cycles of BEP or 4 cycles of vasoactive intestinal peptide (etoposide, ifosphamide, cisplatin) for intermediate- or poor-risk TGCT[ 5 , 12 , 13 ]. Given the cumulative toxicity of bleomycine, a regimen of 3 cycles of BEP followed by 1 cycle of EP has been utilized in certain patients with intermediate risk. This schedule may be curtailed if a patient experiences a TEE due to safety concerns. Treating a TEE in cancer patients is challenging due to the risk of recurrent TEE with continuation of systemic chemotherapy and a higher bleeding risk than in patients without cancer[ 14 ]. Herein, we present 68 patients with TGCT all of whom underwent cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The factors associated with an increased risk of TEE in this patient population are discussed. An analysis of thromboprophylaxis in the ambulatory setting for patients with high-risk cancer is also presented."

The mean BMI at the first medical oncology visit following orchiectomy and before the initiation of chemotherapy was 29 (18.6-58.4). A total of 35 (51%) patients were current or previous cigarette smokers, and 16 (23.5%) patients were current cannabis users. Characteristics of patients with testicular germ cell tumors at our Institution BMI: Body mass index; BEP: Bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin; EP: Etoposide and cisplatin; RPLN: Retroperitoneal lymph node; RPLND: Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. The majority [49 (72%)] of patients were diagnosed with a non-seminoma and were pathologic stage II (Table  1 ). A total of 18 (26%) patients had retroperitoneal lymph nodes RPLN ≥ 3.0 cm before chemotherapy, and a slightly higher number of TCGT were on the left [35 (52%)]. Most patients were treated with 3 cycles of BEP. A total of 18 (26.5%) patients underwent a RPLND, consisting of 6 before chemotherapy and 12 afterwards. RPLND is an option prior to chemotherapy in cases of mixed germ cell tumors with negative tumor markers and evidence of retroperitoneal adenopathy. RPLND is a viable possibility especially if a teratoma is suspected, the tumor is not bulky, or if the patient prefers to avoid chemotherapy. Only 1 patient had a family history of testicular cancer, specifically, in a paternal uncle. One patient was treated with 17 fractions of 2250 cGy radiation after the orchiectomy and prior to the chemotherapy. Five patients experienced recurrent disease necessitating a second course of chemotherapy after their initial cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen. One of these patients underwent several additional courses of chemotherapy including high dose chemotherapy with autotransplant, however, succumbed to progressive disease 5 years after his orchiectomy. His death was the only one in our study. A total of 19 (28%) patients experienced a TEE, consisting of 8 PEs, 8 DVTs, and both a PE and DVT in 3 patients (Table  2 ). Six patients with a TEE had a CVC for delivering chemotherapy. Four of the DVT were peripheral inserted central catheter-line related. Two patients had infusaports, one of whom had no evidence of a fibrin sheath or pericatheter thrombus detected by fluoroscopic evaluation. The other patient had a family history of thromboembolic conditions. Thromboembolic events in patients with testicular germ cell tumors who underwent cisplatin-based chemotherapy at our Institution ( n  = 19) Infusaport. Peripherally inserted central catheter line. PE: Pulmonary embolism; BEP: Bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin; DVT: Deep vein thrombosis; EP: Etoposide and cisplatin. Eight (42%) patients were diagnosed with a seminoma, and patients were either pathologic stage II [14 (74%)] or stage III [5 (26%)] (Table  2 ). The RPLN were ≥ 3.0 cm before chemotherapy in 8 patients (42%). The relative proportions of TEEs by at least one type stage was significantly different from the other stages ( P  = 0.05) (Table  3 ). Patients with stage IS testicular cancer were significantly ( P  = 0.03) less likely to experience a TEE compared to patients who had stages II or III. Note that no patients with stage IS testicular cancer had a TEE. Comparison of metrics between patients with testicular germ cell tumors at our Institution stratified by those who experienced a thromboembolic event and those who did not BMI: Body mass index; BEP: Bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin; EP: Etoposide and cisplatin; RPLN: Retroperitoneal lymph node; RPLND: Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Most patients were scheduled to undergo 3 cycles of BEP. The relative proportions of TEEs by at least one type of chemotherapy treatment was significantly different from the other chemotherapy types ( P  = 0.004) (Table  3 ). Patients who were treated with BEP/EP and EP were significantly 5-times (1.02-28.3,  P = 0.02) more likely to experience a TEE compared to patients who were only treated with BEP. The TEE occurred during the cisplatin-based chemotherapy in 13 (68%) patients. A total of 18 (95%) patients underwent anticoagulant therapy, and 10 (56%) patients were hospitalized for management of their TEE. Eight (42%) patients were current or ex-cigarette smokers, and 3 (16%) were current cannabis users. One patient sustained bilateral PE and a DVT 3 years after the completion of 4 cycles of EP when he experienced recurrent testicular disease. He was hospitalized and treated with enoxaparin. This patient also experienced recurrent disease and was the sole death in our study."

        "section_name": "DISCUSSION",
        "content": "Cisplatin chemotherapy has been reported to cause PE, DVT, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial thrombosis[ 11 , 15 , 16 ]. Several pathogenic mechanisms have been identified between cisplatin and thrombosis, including endothelial cell damage marked by increased plasma levels of Von Willebrand factor during chemotherapy, platelet activation, and up-regulation of prothrombotic factors. Lauritsen  et al [ 17 ] investigated cardiovascular risk factors and disease following BEP treatment for male germ cell cancer[ 17 ]. These authors reported that patients had a more than 20-fold increased hazard ratio of venous TEE compared with the normal population which decreased to a hazard ratio of 1.4 after 10 years. In our literature review the percentage of patients who experienced a TEE with testicular cancer ranged between 5.2% and 19%[ 6 , 9 , 16 , 18 , 19 ]. Most of the TEE occurred during chemotherapy[ 9 , 16 , 18 , 19 ]. Various risk factors for a TEE were confirmed, including retroperitoneal and supraclavicular lymph node metastases, elevated serum lactic acid dehydrogenase, higher clinical stage, CVC, high body surface area, and febrile neutropenia. Paffenholz  et al [ 16 ] reported a significantly reduced overall survival in patients with a TEE during a median follow-up of 8 mo[ 16 ]. The present study concurs with this finding, as the TEE occurred during the cisplatin-based chemotherapy in 13 (68%) patients. The Khorana score is a predictive model for chemotherapy-associated TEE and is based on the following: (1) Site of cancer; (2) Prechemotherapy platelet count 350 × 10 9 /L or more; (3) Hemoglobin level less than 100 g/L or use of red cell growth factors; (4) Prechemotherapy leukocyte count more than 11 × 10 9 /L; and (5) BMI 35 kg/m 2  or more[ 2 , 20 , 21 ]. The risk of TEE is 4-6-fold higher in patients with cancer than in those without, and the TEE incidence is 3%-15% annually in cancer patients[ 14 , 18 ]. The use of thromboprophylaxis to reduce the recurrence of cancer-associated TEE have been examined primarily in cancers such as breast, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, and multiple myeloma that usually affect older individuals[ 14 , 21 - 24 ]. Carrier  et al [ 22 ] determined that apixaban resulted in a significantly lower rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than placebo among intermediate-to-high-risk ambulatory patients with cancer who started chemotherapy[ 22 ]. In the intention-to-treat analysis, major bleeding occurred in 10 (3.5%) patients in the apixaban group and in 5 (1.8%) patients in the placebo group ( P  = 0.046). Khorana  et al [ 25 ] concluded that high-risk ambulatory patients with metastatic cancer who were receiving chemotherapy and were treated with rivaroxaban did not have a significantly lower incidence of VTE or death due to VTE in a 180-d trial period[ 25 ]. Despite these two large randomized phase III trials, routine prophylaxis for TEE has not been embraced by clinicians in the outpatient setting as the absolute risk reduction is small and thromboprophylaxis is associated with a heightened risk of major bleeding and high cost[ 14 , 18 , 22 ]. Of the 574 patients in Carrier and colleagues’ placebo-controlled study, only 3 patients were diagnosed with testicular cancer. Khorana  et al [ 25 ]’s study of 1080 patients did not specify the number of patients with testicular cancer, however, mentioned that there were 32 cases of “genitourinary” cancers that included renal, bladder, ureteral, and testicular cancers but not prostate cancer. Young men with TGCT are generally without co-morbidities. This patient population was not represented in large trials investigating thromboprophylaxis in metastatic cancer during chemotherapy. This is largely due to inclusion and exclusion criteria based on the Khorana scoring system used in these trials. The cisplatin-based chemotherapy used to treat TGCT often does not cause severe thrombocytopenia. A relatively short course of chemotherapy in metastatic testicular cancer often leads to a cure despite the need for ongoing systemic therapy in most other metastatic solid tumors. Additionally, the cisplatin dose in the BEP regimen is higher compared to most regimens used for non-testicular cancer. This important difference may lead to better outcomes with the use of thromboprophylaxis. TGCT possesses numerous risk factors that increase the risk for clotting including bulky retroperitoneal disease, cisplatin-based chemotherapy, cigarette smoking, and possibly marijuana use. Furthermore, the risk of bleeding in TGCT is likely to be lower compared to other types of cancers due to the shorter duration of chemotherapy in TGCT and younger patient population with better bone marrow function. These factors support further investigation into the use of thromboprophylaxis as patients receive chemotherapy for TGCT. We propose conducting a multicenter randomized double blind placebo control trial examining the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing systemic treatment for metastatic TGCT. Such a trial will use a novel inclusion scoring system specific for TGCT that incorporates risk factors often encountered with this cancer. Carrier  et al [ 22 ]’s as well as Khorana  et al [ 25 ]’s studies only included patients who had 2 risk factors on the Khorana scale[ 22 , 25 ]. Most of the patients who experienced a TEE in the present study would not have fulfilled the criteria for inclusion for thromboprophylaxis in these 2 trials. The new TGCT scoring system should incorporate the following risk factors: Higher pathologic stage and greater number of chemotherapy cycles as confirmed by the current study as well as elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, CVC, large RPLN, and seminoma[ 6 , 9 , 16 , 18 , 19 ]. Several studies have reported the limited use of thromboprophylaxis in TGCT with cisplatin-based chemotherapy (Table  4 ). Paffenholz  et al [ 16 ] reported that 93% of all of their TCGT received prophylactic anticoagulation which is customary in Germany[ 16 ]. Thromboprophylaxis during chemotherapy for TGCT is not customary in the United States. Patients with testicular germ cell tumors who underwent cisplatin-based chemotherapy and experienced a thromboembolic event in the literature TGCT: Testicular germ cell tumor; TEE: Thromboembolic event; LDH: Lactic acid dehydrogenase; RPLN: Retroperitoneal lymph node; CVC: Central venous catheter. Kentucky has both the highest incidence and death rates for lung cancer in the United States[ 26 , 27 ]. In 2017, a total of 24.6% of adults in Kentucky smoked while the national average was 14.0%[ 26 , 28 ]. Cigarette smoking is a well-recognized risk factor for both atherosclerotic disease and TEE[ 29 ]. Half of the patients in our study were either current or previous cigarette smokers, and 42% of these patients experienced a TEE while undergoing cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Cannabis is the most commonly used recreation drug in the United States and has been suggested to cause myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke[ 30 ]. Only a single case of PE in a young male following heavy cannabis use has been reported[ 30 ]. It has been suggested that cannabinoids, the active component of cannabis, cause endothelial cell disruption leading to vascular thrombosis. A total of 23.5% of the patients in our study were current cannabis users, and 16% of the cannabis users suffered a TEE while undergoing chemotherapy. Our study of TCGT offers several unique aspects that shed light on the risk factors for a TEE and educational opportunities for preventing a TEE. Our study, consisting of a single Institution in a metropolitan community in Kentucky, has a large number of patients with TCGT over a 6-year period. The high percentage (28%) of patients who experienced a TEE compared to the literature may be attributed to numerous cumulative factors leading to a hypercoagulable state that may provoke a TEE, including bulky retroperitoneal disease, higher pathologic stage, greater number of chemotherapy cycles, metastatic disease, the remarkably large number of patients who smoke cigarettes and use cannabis, high number of patients with CVC, and lack of patients who were treated with thromboprophylaxis. The limitation of the present study is its retrospective nature and limited number of patients. Several risk factors have been identified as increasing the risk of developing VTE, including the patient’s age (> 60 years), obesity, and history of anterior VTE[ 31 ]. The tumor’s site, histological type, and stage also elevate the risk of VTE. Pancreatic cancer is the solid tumor with the highest likelihood of VTE, while lymphoma, acute leukemia, and multiple myeloma represent hematologic malignancies that pose a strong risk of VTE. Adenocarcinomas have a higher risk of VTE compared to squamous cell carcinomas, and an advanced tumor stage increases the prospect of developing a VTE[ 31 ]. Advanced tumor stage and use of subclavian catheters are the main risk factors for CVC-associated thrombosis[ 32 ]. Our Institution generally does not use CVC for delivering chemotherapy in patients with TCGT. However, CVC placement may be unavoidable for patients with poor venous access or patient preference. Educating patients and providers about the thromboembolic risk of CVC may discourage them from selecting CVC as the desired route of chemotherapy infusion. Further educational opportunities with patients that may decrease the likelihood of TEE and enhance overall medical health include an emphasis on discontinuing cigarette smoking and cannabis use as well as promoting weight loss."

        "section_name": "CONCLUSION",
        "content": "Although patients with TGCT are a relatively healthy population due to their young age, myriad risk factors such as bulky retroperitoneal disease, higher clinical stage, CVC, cigarette smoking, and cannabis use may heighten their risk of developing a TEE during cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Patients with TGCT who experience a TEE may be unable to complete the course of prescribed chemotherapy despite initiating treatment with an anticoagulant. There may be a significant increase in cost of care following a TEE, including hospital stay, potential requirement for an aggressive procedure, and need for a longer duration of anticoagulation. Patients who could not complete the course of prescribed chemotherapy due to TEE will likely need more frequent medical oncology appointments with monitoring tumor markers as well as closer follow-up imaging studies which can substantially escalate the cost of patient care. High-risk ambulatory patients with TGCT treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy may benefit from treatment with primary prophylactic anticoagulation to mitigate the potential morbidity and mortality associated with a TEE. Multi-institutional randomized studies are warranted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of thromboprophylaxis during chemotherapy for TGCT in this young patient population."

        "content": "Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has significantly increased the survival of patients with testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT), although it is associated with a high rate of thromboembolic events (TEE). As TGCT is the most curable solid tumor and most common cancer among men 18-39 years, we sought to evaluate our single-center experience of patients who were diagnosed with TGCT and received platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients who suffered a TEE were the primary focus of this study. Our objective was to identify patients who were diagnosed with TGCT and received platinum-based chemotherapy, with particular attention to those patients who experienced a TEE. The medical records and imaging studies of 68 consecutive individuals who were diagnosed with TGCT and received platinum-based chemotherapy at our Institution in a metropolitan community between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019 were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed by stratisfying each metric (TEE, retroperitoneal lymph nodes ≥ 3.0 cm before chemotherapy, age, body mass index, cigarette smoker, marijuana use, side of orchiectomy, pathologic stage, central venous catheter, type of chemotherapy, number of chemotherapy cycles, retroperitoneal lymph nodes dissection, and recurrence after chemotherapy by those patients who experienced a TEE and by those who did not. A total of 19 (28%) patients experienced a TEE following orchiectomy which occurred during chemotherapy in 13 (68%) of these patients. Patients with a higher pathologic stage (stage III) were significantly ( P  = 0.023) more likely to experience a TEE compared to patients who had a lower stage. Patients who were treated with 3 cycles of bleomycine, etoposide, and cisplatin and 1 cycle of etoposide and cisplatin or 4 cycles of etoposide and cisplatin were significantly 5 ( P = 0.02) times more likely to experience a TEE compared to patients who were treated with only 3 cycles of bleomycine, etoposide, and cisplatin. Since myriad factors predispose to a TEE such as large retroperitoneal disease, higher clinical stage, greater number of chemotherapy cycle, central venous catheter, cigarette smoking, and possible cannabis use, high-risk ambulatory patients with TGCT treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy may benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation. Randomized studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prophylactic anticoagulants are essential in this young patient population generally lacking medical co-morbidities."

    "title": "Vascular fingerprint tool to identify patients with testicular cancer treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy at high risk of early cardiovascular events ☆",
    "abstract": "Background Patients with testicular cancer treated with chemotherapy have an increased risk of developing early cardiovascular events. Identification of patients with testicular cancer at a high risk of these events enables the development of preventative strategies. This study validates the vascular fingerprint tool to identify these patients. Patients and methods We carried out a multicenter prospective study in patients with metastatic testicular cancer [International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) good or intermediate risk; retroperitoneal mass <5 cm]. In eligible patients, the vascular fingerprint was assessed before the start of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, which consists of five risk factors, namely, smoking, overweight (body mass index >25 kg/m 2 ), hypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mmHg), dyslipidemia (fasting cholesterol >5.1 mmol/l or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol >2.5 mmol/l), and diabetes mellitus (fasting glucose ≥7.0 mmol/l). The presence of three or more risk factors was defined as high-risk vascular fingerprints. A log-rank test was carried out with a cardiovascular event within 1 year after the start of chemotherapy as the primary endpoint. Results A total of 196 patients with metastatic testicular cancer were included; 15 patients (8%) developed a cardiovascular event: 4 (2%) arterial events and 11 (6%) venous thrombotic events. Overall, 189 vascular fingerprint scores were available. Patients with a high-risk vascular fingerprint (62/189) had a higher risk of developing a cardiovascular event (hazard ratio 3.27, 95% confidence interval 1.16-9.18; log-rank:  P  = 0.017). Histological diagnosis, prognosis group, cumulative chemotherapy dose, and retroperitoneal mass size did not differ between patients with or without a cardiovascular event. All patients with an arterial event had a high-risk vascular fingerprint compared with 5/11 patients with a venous event. Overweight was more prevalent in patients with cardiovascular events (87% versus 59%;  P  = 0.037). Conclusions The vascular fingerprint is a validated tool to identify patients with testicular cancer at a high risk of developing early cardiovascular events. This tool can be used to develop preventative strategies with anticoagulant treatment.",

        "content": "In recent decades, the number of testicular cancer (TC) survivors has increased. This is the result of a rise in incidence and excellent survival rates; even in advanced stages, survival rates are >90%, as a result of the introduction of platinum-based chemotherapy in the late 1970s. 1  Despite excellent cure rates, TC survivors are at an increased risk of developing life-threatening treatment complications during and after treatment, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). 2  In particular, within the first year after the start of chemotherapy cardiovascular events are serious treatment-related causes of morbidity and mortality. 2  These can consist of both arterial and venous thromboembolic events. Cardiovascular events during treatment can postpone chemotherapy courses or result in premature termination of chemotherapy, which can lead to less effective cancer treatment. Standard prophylactic anticoagulation therapy is not implemented in current guidelines. The outcomes of previous studies on the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with TC patients remain uncertain. 3 ,  4 ,  5  There is an unmet need to identify high-risk patients with TC before the start of chemotherapy in whom prophylactic anticoagulant treatment may prevent cardiovascular events. If patients with TC who are at risk of cardiovascular events can be identified accurately, preventive strategies, such as prophylactic anticoagulation, can be developed and implemented more safely and effectively. In a small prospective study, Lubberts et al. 6  developed the ‘vascular fingerprint tool’ that identified patients with TC at high risk of developing cardiovascular events within 1 year after the start of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The vascular fingerprint is a simple selection tool consisting of five traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The presence of three or more of these risk factors in patients with TC at the start of chemotherapy is defined as a high-risk vascular fingerprint: such patients are considered to be at high risk of developing a cardiovascular event. Lubberts et al. 6  found that patients with a high-risk vascular fingerprint at the beginning of chemotherapy developed cardiovascular events, especially arterial events, more often within 1 year after the start of chemotherapy than patients with a low-risk vascular fingerprint. The aim of this study was to validate the vascular fingerprint as a selection tool to identify patients with TC who are at high risk of developing cardiovascular events within the first year after starting cisplatin-based chemotherapy."

        "content": "Between June 2015 and May 2021, we carried out a multicenter, prospective, cohort study in patients with disseminated TC in four Dutch hospitals and one hospital in Portugal. All centers were experienced in treating patients with TC. Eligibility criteria were as follows: diagnosed with metastatic TC, classified according to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) as good- or intermediate prognosis, 7  <50 years of age at the start of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria were a history of CVD, a retroperitoneal tumor mass >5 cm, and the use of or indication for anticoagulant therapy at the start of chemotherapy. Patient characteristics before the start of chemotherapy were collected to assess the vascular fingerprint score. Four to six weeks after the last course of chemotherapy, treatment response was assessed by evaluating tumor marker normalization and a computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen. Based on the restaging, it was decided whether additional treatment, such as retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, was necessary. One year after the start of chemotherapy, any cardiovascular events or relapses were registered, including arterial and venous vascular events [World Health Organization (WHO) ICD-10 I1–99]. During regular clinical care before the start of chemotherapy, the patient’s medical history, disease and treatment characteristics, smoking behavior, and medication use were assessed. Weight, height, and blood pressure (using a sphygmomanometer) were measured during a physical examination. A single fasting blood sample was drawn to determine total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and glucose. The vascular fingerprint score consists of five traditional cardiovascular risk factors, namely, overweight, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and impaired glucose tolerance ( Figure 1 ). 6  The maximum vascular fingerprint score is 5; 1 point for each of the aforementioned risk factors. Overweight was defined as a body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m 2 ; smoking as active smoking at the start of chemotherapy or smoking an average of one or more cigarettes per day during the past year; hypertension as a blood pressure of >140/90 mmHg or use of antihypertensive drugs; dyslipidemia as a total cholesterol of >5.1 mmol/l or LDL-cholesterol of >2.5 mmol/l or use of lipid-lowering drugs; and impaired glucose tolerance as fasting glucose of ≥7 mmol/l or use of blood glucose-lowering drugs. A score of ≥3 was defined as a high-risk vascular fingerprint. 6 Figure 1 High-risk vascular fingerprint.

BMI, body mass index; LDL, low-density lipoprotein.  a Or use of anti-hypertensive, lipid-lowering or blood glucose-lowering drugs. The Khorana score, a known and validated score that predicts the chance of developing venous thromboembolism in patients with all types of cancer, was also calculated. 8  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a known risk factor for cardiovascular events, and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), an essential blood-clotting protein, were also measured. The following cardiovascular events that occurred within 1 year after the start of chemotherapy were registered: myocardial infarction (WHO ICD-10, I20-I25), ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (WHO ICD-10, I63-I66 and G45), infarction in other specific organ systems (WHO ICD-10, K76.3, K55, D73.5, M62.2, and N28.0), and venous thromboembolic events (WHO ICD-10, I26, and I81-82). Thrombophlebitis (WHO ICD-10 I80) was also registered but not defined as an event aimed to identify with the vascular fingerprint because it is superficial with often clinically mild presentation and without a clear indication for therapeutic anticoagulant therapy. However, in our study, some patients received anticoagulant therapy for thrombophlebitis. This was registered because of a presumed lower risk of developing a more severe cardiovascular event after treatment with anticoagulant therapy. Based on the article of Lubberts et al., 6  19% of patients with TC with a high-risk vascular fingerprint developed an arterial cardiovascular event, compared with 2% of patients without a high-risk vascular fingerprint. To confirm the difference (17%) between these groups, and thus validate the vascular fingerprint as a selection tool, 155 patients should be included to reach 80% power (α = 0.05, two-sided testing), assuming a 1 : 4 distribution between the groups. Estimating that 15% of patients would be nonassessable, a total minimum number of 178 patients was needed. For the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the patients that were normally distributed, means and standard deviations were used. If characteristics were not normally distributed, medians and ranges were used. To compare differences between groups, Mann–Whitney  U  tests were used when comparing groups with continuous data that were not normally distributed, and unpaired  t -tests for normally distributed data. The chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test when expected counts were <5) was used when comparing categorical variables between groups. A log-rank analysis was carried out to determine whether patients with TC with a high-risk vascular fingerprint had a higher risk of developing a cardiovascular event. This analysis was carried out first for all cardiovascular events, and then separately for arterial and venous events. Patients who developed thrombophlebitis and received anticoagulant treatment were allocated to the noncardiovascular event group and censored at the beginning of anticoagulant treatment. In an additional analysis, age and FVIII were added as risk factors to the vascular fingerprint tool. This was done with receiver operating characteristic curves and evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (see  Supplementary Methods , available at  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103631 ). P  values were reported as two-sided and considered significant when <0.05. All data were analyzed with SPSS statistics 23.0 (IBM Inc., Chicago, IL). Procedures in this study were carried out in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and were reviewed by the Ethical Approval Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen on 10 September 2015 (reference number: METC 2015/399). Written informed consent of all participants was obtained. The study is registered in  ClinicalTrials.gov  ( NCT02573584 )."

No significant differences were found regarding histological diagnosis; IGCCCG prognosis group; size of retroperitoneal mass; BMI; blood pressure; FVIII; LDH; and cumulative dose of cisplatin, bleomycin, and etoposide. The Khorana score did not differ between both groups and was not predictive for the development of both arterial and venous events combined, and for venous events only (data not shown).

        "content": "Patients with disseminated TC treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular events. In this validation study, the vascular fingerprint tool was shown to be effective in upfront identifying patients with TC at high risk for developing a cardiovascular event within the first year after the start of chemotherapy. Patients with a high-risk vascular fingerprint had a three times higher risk of developing a cardiovascular event. The vascular fingerprint tool is particularly effective in identifying patients at high risk of arterial events. The proportion of patients with cardiovascular events in our study was relatively small. A previous retrospective single-center study describing six different studies reported that the percentage of patients with TC with (mainly venous) thromboembolic events was between 5.2% and 26.5%. 9  The relatively small number of events in our study could be explained by the exclusion of patients with TC with a large retroperitoneal mass (>5 cm) and a poor prognosis, both known risk factors for cardiovascular events. 4  By not including these patients in the current study, the vascular fingerprint tool could especially be validated in patients that were previously not qualified as high risk. Furthermore, the original study by Lubberts et al. 6  was carried out in one single center in which the study population could have had a worse cardiovascular risk profile before treatment. Despite the relatively low number of events in our study, the vascular fingerprint appeared to be a useful tool to identify patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. The current study showed that being overweight is an important risk factor for developing a cardiovascular event. Being overweight is a fundamental cause of other cardiovascular risk factors and often results in hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes at a later stage. 10  As a substantial number of patients with TC develop overweight and metabolic syndrome within 5 years after the start of chemotherapy, it is important to implement lifestyle interventions (eating a healthy diet, being more physically active, and quitting smoking) as early as possible. 11  Unfortunately, because of the lack of time between diagnosis and the start of chemotherapy, its short-term benefits on the development of cardiovascular events during and shortly after chemotherapy would be limited. The results indicated that the vascular fingerprint is especially useful in identifying patients at high risk for developing arterial events. The pathophysiology of arterial events differs from that of venous events. Arterial events are caused by vascular endothelial damage and high-shear stress, whereas venous events are a result of stasis and hypercoagulability. 12  Currently, routine use of prophylactic anticoagulation for patients with disseminated TC during chemotherapy is not recommended because it is unclear which patients are at high risk of developing thromboembolic events. 13 , 14  The updated European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical treatment guideline of 2022 for TC recommends practitioners to consider prophylactic anticoagulation for patients with metastatic TC who have a retroperitoneal lymph node >3.5 cm, stage III disease, or are classified as poor risk. 13  The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines only provide a general recommendation; for individual patients with TC, the potential benefits and risks of prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events should be considered. 14  The studies cited in the EAU guidelines mainly concerned thromboprophylaxis for venous thromboembolic events in various cancer types. 15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18  Both the ESMO and EAU guidelines recommend avoiding vascular access devices whenever possible. 13 , 14  In our study, no poor-risk patients were included, only 10 patients had a retroperitoneal mass between 3.5 and 5 cm, and 1 patient had a central vascular access device, but none of these developed a cardiovascular event. Other known risk factors for developing cardiovascular events in patients with TC are elevated LDH levels and a high Khorana score, 19 ,  20 ,  21  but both risk factors were not discriminatory for the development of cardiovascular events in this study. Previous studies on the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with TC remain scarce, and the results have been contradictory. 3 ,  4 ,  5 , 19 , 22  Arguments in favor of administering prophylactic anticoagulation to high-risk patients with TC were that a significant decrease in thromboembolic events was achieved and that its benefit outweighed the risk of bleeding. 4 , 5 , 19  Arguments against thromboprophylaxis were that it did not reduce the frequency of thrombosis, 3 , 22  but instead resulted in more bleeding complications. 3  A review by Meng et al. 4  described a large variety of risk factors for thromboembolic events during platinum-based chemotherapy, which shows that it is challenging to identify patients with TC at a high risk of a cardiovascular event. Our vascular fingerprint can identify patients with TC at a higher risk, especially arterial events, so it could be used to adequately select patients for treatment strategies to prevent cardiovascular events. When selecting patients with TC for prophylactic anticoagulation therapy in future clinical trials, it should be considered that the pathophysiology of arterial events differs from that of venous events. 12  Both of these events can have a major impact on the patients, their treatment, and their quality of life afterward. The treatment of arterial events is different from that of venous events. Arterial events are usually treated with various types of anticoagulants (e.g. direct oral anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, or vitamin K antagonists), whereas venous events are often treated with low-molecular-weight heparins. 23  Prophylactic treatment with statins could also be considered in patients with TC because it is known to effectively prevent cardiovascular events and it can be used in conjunction with anticoagulant treatment. 24 , 25  In the recently updated American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) clinical guideline of 2023 for patients with cancer, the direct factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, were added as options for extended thromboprophylaxis after cancer surgery. 26  This guideline also suggests consideration of apixaban, rivaroxaban, or low-molecular-weight heparin as optional prophylaxis for high-risk outpatients with cancer, after individual discussions about relative benefits and harms. 26  In future trials, it is of high importance to identify an optimal combination of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of both arterial and venous events. To our knowledge, no studies have been published on physical long-term outcomes in patients with TC who developed a cardiovascular event during chemotherapy treatment. It is known that patients with TC who have developed CVD reported impaired quality of life in physical domains. 27  These results emphasize the importance of preventing cardiovascular events in patients with TC. Our study and the vascular fingerprint tool have several strengths. First, the vascular fingerprint tool can be easily implemented in routine clinical care because no additional protocols or expensive measurements are needed. Second, we conducted a multicenter study, which improves the generalizability of the vascular fingerprint tool. A potential limitation of this study is the presence of thrombophlebitis in six patients who were treated with anticoagulants. As these patients received anticoagulants, it was unlikely that they would develop a major cardiovascular event thereafter. However, a log-rank analysis accounted for this potential confounding. Another confounder is age, a known risk factor for cardiovascular events that was not included in the vascular fingerprint tool. It might be needed to approach patients with TC at an older age differently regarding preventive strategies because they are more likely to develop arterial events. In conclusion, the vascular fingerprint is a simple useful tool and has now been validated to identify patients with disseminated TC who are at high risk for developing cardiovascular events during or after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Being overweight is an important component of the vascular fingerprint and thereby an early risk factor for developing a cardiovascular event. Therefore, lifestyle changes should be advised, but their benefits before the start of chemotherapy would be limited. A high-risk vascular fingerprint at the start of chemotherapy adequately selects patients with TC at a high risk of developing cardiovascular events who might benefit from interventions to prevent such events. Future clinical trials should evaluate lifestyle interventions and the use of prophylactic anticoagulants in these identified high-risk patients."

    "title": "CT Rendering and Radiomic Analysis in Post-Chemotherapy Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection for Testicular Cancer to Anticipate Difficulties for Young Surgeons",
    "abstract": "Post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) in non-seminomatous germ-cell tumor (NSTGCTs) is a complex procedure. We evaluated whether 3D computed tomography (CT) rendering and their radiomic analysis help predict resectability by junior surgeons. The ambispective analysis was performed between 2016–2021. A prospective group (A) of 30 patients undergoing CT was segmented using the 3D Slicer software while a retrospective group (B) of 30 patients was evaluated with conventional CT (without 3D reconstruction). CatFisher’s exact test showed a  p -value of 0.13 for group A and 1.0 for Group B. The difference between the proportion test showed a  p -value of 0.009149 (IC 0.1–0.63). The proportion of the correct classification showed a  p -value of 0.645 (IC 0.55–0.87) for A, and 0.275 (IC 0.11–0.43) for Group B. Furthermore, 13 shape features were extracted: elongation, flatness, volume, sphericity, and surface area, among others. Performing a logistic regression with the entire dataset,  n  = 60, the results were: Accuracy: 0.7 and Precision: 0.65. Using  n  = 30 randomly chosen, the best result obtained was Accuracy: 0.73 and Precision: 0.83, with a  p -value: 0.025 for Fisher’s exact test. In conclusion, the results showed a significant difference in the prediction of resectability with conventional CT versus 3D reconstruction by junior surgeons versus experienced surgeons. Radiomic features used to elaborate an artificial intelligence model improve the prediction of resectability. The proposed model could be of great support in a university hospital, allowing it to plan the surgery and to anticipate complications.",

        "content": "Germ cell cancer (GCC) represents one of the most common solid neoplasms affecting young adult men aged 18–44 years and its incidence has risen worldwide in the past two decades [ 1 ]. During the past 40 years, there has been an improvement in the survival rates and in the curative rate for men diagnosed with testicular cancer, due a multimodal approach to the management of GCC with the integration of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Moreover, its effective management depends on the knowledge of the pattern of the metastatic spread of disease, primarily to the lymph nodes of the retroperitoneum and to the lung and posterior mediastinum. The retroperitoneal lymph nodes are the most frequent site of metastasis in advanced testicular tumors. The European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines on testicular cancer suggest retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (primary) as the primary treatment in (a) high-risk stage IB patients, (b) highly selected non-seminoma patients, (c) patients with a contraindication to adjuvant chemotherapy and are unwilling to accept surveillance, (d) postpubertal teratoma with a somatic malignant component, and (e) metastatic disease after chemotherapy for stage II or III seminomatous or non-seminomatous germ-cell tumors (NSGCT), depending on the tumor size or after lack of response to chemotherapy [ 2 ]. The main parts of RPLND nowadays are therefore being carried out in the postchemotherapy situation. About one-third of patients who received chemotherapy for disseminated GCC have residual disease and demand surgery [ 3 ]. Despite the advent of effective chemotherapy offering an adjunct to the technically challenging surgery, RPLND remains an essential part of the treatment algorithm for NSGCT. As opposed to primary RPLND, the surgery in the postchemotherapy setting is more cumbersome and requires complementary procedures [ 4 ]. The rationale for post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) is to remove persistent retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Approximately 30–40% of metastatic NSGCTs exhibit residual tumors after first-line chemotherapy that may contain necrosis/fibrosis (40–50%), mature teratomas (20–40%), or viable carcinoma cells (10–20%). Teratomas are resistant to conventional treatments, so a complete surgical resection with a bilateral retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy rather than salvage radiotherapy or chemotherapy is the first choice [ 3 ]. Regrettably, modern imaging techniques poorly differentiated residual necrosis/fibrosis, teratoma, or viable cancer after chemotherapy [ 5 ] and neither predict whether the residual masses can be successfully resected or not. Currently, a shift in the imaging field is taking place: with new interest from the qualitative interpretation of medical imaging to an emphasis on the extraction of quantitative information from medical imaging (namely, radiomics). Radiomics refers to the extraction and analysis of large numbers of advanced quantitative imaging features (radiomic features—RF) from medical images using high throughput methods. Radiomics has two main arms based on how imaging information is transformed into mineable data: handcrafted radiomics and deep learning [ 6 ]. Radiomics is an attractive research topic in uro-oncology [ 7 ]. Volume rendering is a set of computer methods to obtain an image projection; rendered computerized tomography is not sufficient to obtain a precise visual classification. For this reason, this last task must be complemented with manual or semi-automatic segmentation [ 8 ]. The subsequent analysis of radiomic features finally aims at supporting clinical decision making and overcomes the limitations of a purely visual image interpretation [ 9 ]. The complete resection of residual retroperitoneal masses in GCC is challenging, even for experienced surgeons, due to their deep anatomic location, desmoplastic reaction, dense peritumoral adhesions, and proximity to major blood vessels or organs. An accurate understanding of the anatomy of the retroperitoneum before the surgical approach is essential for ensuring the achievement of the procedure, especially for young surgeons during the learning curve. We hypothesized that computerized tomography segment rendering with radiomic extraction could identify whether PC-RP residual masses are resectable during the pre-operative stage by young surgeons."

        "content": "The proposed single-institution and ambispective study included patients diagnosed with NSGCT between 1 January 2016 and 31 October 2021, who had residual retroperitoneal masses after chemotherapy and had undergone PC-RPLND by two surgeons (one training surgeon and one senior surgeon). The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, and local ethics committee approval (Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia) was obtained (n. 2020/0123). For analyses, we selected 30 patients from database of 570 patients who underwent PC-RPLND (retrospective group) and 30 new patients (prospective group) with tumor size from 1 to 13 cm. We considered the retrospective group, as a historical cohort, to compare and to explore the difference of the resectability in those cases studied pre-operatively only by 2D conventional computerized tomography (CT) versus prospective group studied by 3D reconstruction. The decision to perform pcRPLND was individualized and was taken after discussion in the multi-specialty approach. According to our institution policy, PC-RPLND is performed in patients with NSGCT and a post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal nodal mass more than 1 cm with normal tumor markers. It is also indicated for patients with seminoma and retroperitoneal nodal mass bigger than 3 cm that is positive on a positron emission tomography (PET) combined with the computerized tomography (CT). Patients underwent clinical examination and testing of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) one week before the PC-RPLND. CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed four weeks prior to the procedure or after four or six weeks after the beginning of the last cycle of chemotherapy. The testicular primary tumor was removed before the chemotherapy and, in only two cases, the orchiectomy was delayed following chemotherapy; in neither case was the orchiectomy in conjunction with the PC-RPLND. CS I seminoma, with high risk for recurrence, received two adjuvant courses of carboplatin and CS I non-seminoma adjuvant chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and platinum (BEP)X 1. CS IIA/ IIB NSGCT have been treated with BEP X 3 or X4 according to risk categories. For this study, the inclusion criteria were (a) residual nodal size > 1 cm, after frontline cisplatin-based chemotherapy, on CT imaging measured through transverse axial dimension for NSGCT; (b) residual nodal size < 1 cm in patients with intermediate or poor prognosis or pure teratoma in primary orchiectomy specimen; and (c) residual nodal size > 3 cm for seminoma. Exclusion criteria were absence of contrast-enhanced CT imaging data after chemotherapy; insufficient image quality due to motion artifacts, for example; CT performed outside our institution; and images with tumor size > 13 cm, in the retrospective group. Furthermore, we excluded patients without complete clinical data and pre-operative and intraoperative records or underwent primary RPLND. Clinical data included: age, prognostic group according to International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) classification, serum markers at diagnosis, primary histopathology, serum markers before PC-RPLND, type of PC-RPLND (standard, salvage, desperation, and redo-surgery), histopathology of PC-RPLND, evaluation pre-surgery by an expert surgeon, and outcomes of PC-RPLND (unresectable: yes vs. no). All patients were treated with conventional open surgery. We excluded cases of minimally invasive retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Transabdominal approach via a midline laparotomy incision was chosen. We performed in all patients, in addition to the resection of the residual tumor identified by imaging, a modification of the surgical template with “split and roll technique”. According to the modified template, we removed all ipsilateral lymph nodes between the level of the renal vessels and the bifurcation of the common iliac artery. As well as resection of the retroperitoneal residual tumor, we carried out for left-sided testis tumors the resection of para-aortic lymph nodes, and, for right-sided ones, paracaval and inter-aortocaval lymph nodes. All cases of PC-RPLND were classified as:  PC-RPLND standard  (after first-line chemotherapy and negative serum markers),  PC-RPLND salvage  (after more lines of chemotherapy and negative serum markers),  desperation RPLND  (applies to patients with persistently elevated or increasing serum tumor markers after primary inductive chemotherapy or after salvage chemotherapy) and  Redo PC-RPLND  (in cases with recurrent or persistent disease after surgery). We divided patients into a retrospective ( n  = 30) and prospective ( n  = 30) group. Patients in the retrospective group were evaluated before surgery using a conventional CT approach (without 3D reconstruction), while the patients in the prospective group were evaluated and segmented using 3D Slicer software. Specifically, 3D Slicer has been used to extract radiomic variables that can predict tumor resectability. Briefly, all pre-operative CT imaging was evaluated by one expert surgeon, with more than ten years of experience in retroperitoneal surgery, and by junior surgeon in training. From the imaging study, they assessed whether masses were resectable. Statistical analyses of clinical data were performed with SPSS (version 25). Continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared using a two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical variables are presented as frequency and percentages and compared between groups using chi-squared or Fischer’s exact test. We used the Pyradiomics python package (Version 3.6) integrated in 3D Slicer for radiomic feature extraction, and SciPy and scikit-learn libraries for data analysis. CT imaging of the 60 patients corresponding to lymph nodes (LN) was segmented and radiomic features for each LN were extracted after standardized image processing. After stepwise feature reduction based on reproducibility, variable importance, and correlation analyses, radiomic features were selected. A Fisher’s exact test was used to determine if there are non-random associations between preoperative evaluation and surgery results in both groups (using python Scipy library). A two-proportion difference test was performed to determine whether the difference between two proportions of correct association was significant."

The median size of the residual tumor was 89 cm 3 . There were no significant differences between the two subgroups.  Figure 1 ,  Figure 2 ,  Figure 3  and  Figure 4  are examples of prospective cases in which the tumor analyzed pre-operatively with 3D images is totally resected by a young surgeon. No death occurred during the intraoperative and perioperative period in this study. Fisher’s exact test was used to determine if there were non-random associations between the preoperative evaluation and surgical outcomes in both the prospective group (denoted as Group A) and retrospective group (denoted as Group B). The test showed  p -values of 0.13 and 1 for Group A and Group B, respectively. The null hypothesis in both groups is not rejected since there was no statistical significance. Group B offers much more evidence against the null hypothesis than Group A. A two-proportion difference test was then performed to determine whether the difference between the two proportions of the correct association was significant. It showed a  p -value of 0.009149 (IC 0.1–0.63), with the proportion of correct classification having a  p -value of 0.645 (IC 0.55–0.87) and 0.275 (IC 0.11–0.43) for the prospective and the retrospective group, respectively. After a stepwise feature that is reduction-based, thirteen shape features were selected: Elongation, Flatness, LeastAxisLength, MajorAxisLength, Maximum 2D-Diameter Column, Maximum 2D-Diameter Row, Maximum 2D-Diameter Slice, Maximum 3D-Diameter, Mesh Volume, Minor Axis Length, Sphericity, Surface Area, and Surface Volume Ratio. Using the Pyradiomics package, a logistic regression was performed (with the scikit-learn python library) using the entire dataset ( n  = 60). The algorithm identified 29 true negative cases (VPN), 13 true positive cases (PPV), 11 false negative cases, and seven false positives ( Figure 5 ), with Accuracy: 0.7 and Precision: 0.65. Using a random sample of  n  = 30, the best result had an Accuracy of 0.73 and Precision of 0.83, with a  p -value of 0.025 for the Fisher’s exact test."

        "content": "The aim of the study is the prediction of tumor resectability by radiomic segmentation. This topic is critical for the surgeon since retroperitoneal surgery is a very complex procedure; therefore, it is desirable to pre-operatively predict any surgical difficulties. For this reason, we considered two groups of patients: the retrospective group in which patients were evaluated using a conventional CT approach (without 3D reconstruction) and the prospective group in which patients were evaluated and segmented using the 3D Slicer software. The 3D Slicer was also used to identify thirteen radiomic features that may predict tumor resectability. At this point, a logistic regression was performed using the whole data set (retrospective and prospective groups together): 29 true negative cases, 13 true positive cases, 11 false negative cases, and seven false positives were identified with an accuracy of 0.7. The accuracy increased to 0.73 using a random sample of 30 cases. Finally, our statistical analyses showed that there were no non-random associations between the preoperative evaluation and surgical outcomes in both the prospective and retrospective studies. However, the retrospective group offered much more evidence against the null hypothesis than the prospective group. The difference between the proportions test showed that the expert surgeon’s prediction was better by looking at the 3D image than conventional tomography. The retroperitoneum represents the first metastatic site in 75–90% of NSGCTs of the testis. PC-RPLND represents an integral part of the multimodality treatment in patients with advanced testicular germ cell tumors and it is recommended for residual tumors in the retroperitoneum as soon as possible after chemotherapy. A meaningful benefit regarding progression-free survival and cancer-specific survival was achieved with an immediate surgical approach [ 10 ]. The recommendation for the resection of residual masses is based on the observation that, in 35–40% of cases, mature teratoma and, in 10–15%, persistent viable cancer can be found in the PC-RPLND specimen [ 2 , 3 ]. A complete resection of all residual masses during PC-RPLND can be therapeutic, especially in the presence of teratoma, teratoma with somatic transformation, or masses resistant to chemotherapy. Patients with teratoma in the PC-RPLND specimen have excellent disease-free survival of 75–80%, while those with viable GCT have a decreased chance of survival. Surgical approaches are available in the context of open and minimally invasive access [ 2 ]. PC-RPLND is a highly complex procedure, compared with standard retroperitoneal surgery, and may require adjunctive procedures, because residual masses can involve adjacent visceral or vascular structures. Notions of the retroperitoneal anatomy, experience with surgical techniques of the vascular and intestinal structures, and knowledge of the natural history of testicular cancer are imperative for a successful surgery [ 10 ]. Conventional cross-sectional imaging and magnetic resonance imaging identify the shape and size of the post-chemotherapy residual retroperitoneal masses, the anatomy of major vessels, and the presence of anatomical variations of relevant structures such as accessory renal arteries, retroaortic veins, or variants of the vena cava or duplicated ureters. Evaluating the relation between the retroperitoneal tumor and abdominal organs requires the reconstruction of both solid organs, such as the spleen, kidney, liver, and pancreas, and hollow organs, such as the stomach and bladder. When the residual masses are large, there can be an expected involvement of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the abdominal aorta in about 6–10% and 2% of cases, respectively [ 10 , 11 ]. However, these approaches are not able to recognize whether the residual mass is resectable or if it holds viable tumor cells or fibrosis [ 12 ]. The 3D Slicer program has been used in the context of retroperitoneal tumors to determine radiomic variables that can predict their histology. Baessler et al. identified five physical characteristics of tomography, which in an initial model predicted malignancy vs. fibrosis or necrosis with a sensitivity greater than 95% in the pre-test phase, which in its prospective application was adjusted to approximately 85% [ 13 ]. The presence of fibrosis or a desmoplastic reaction in the post-chemotherapy residual masses could complicate the surgical resection. The reaction induced by chemotherapy in residual masses often results in a more difficult resection, with firm adherence to the great vessels and adjacent organs. During the surgery, careful handling is required to avoid injury of the ureter, bowel, and vessels. We propose that CT segment rendering with radiomic feature extraction is essential for supporting experienced surgeons and junior doctors in training during the preoperative stage of the PC-RPLND. Nowadays, medical image analysis, particularly computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, has grown exponentially and helps to plan surgical procedures more precisely, leading to less invasive and more informative diagnoses. Although these tools provide high-resolution two-dimensional images, their ability to describe complex three-dimensional structures is limited [ 14 ]. Three-dimensional reconstruction methods offer a better understanding of anatomical complexity, allowing rotations and segmentations in the virtual model [ 15 ]. This ability has proven useful for the visualization of complex structures such as congenital heart defects and aneurysms. However, the differences between the real anatomical structures and the interpretation of virtual images in three dimensions are still being studied [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ]. It is important to draw up adequate imaging before the surgery, and we argue that CT rendering and radiomic features are superior to conventional imaging during the pre-operative work-out. In this study, we suggest that CT and segment rendering help to predict the resectability of the residual mass and help young surgeons to recognize the anatomy of the tumor. This tool is useful for surgeons in training and for low-volume hospitals to optimize surgical and oncological outcomes. Preoperative planning is the most important part of retroperitoneal surgery, especially for young surgeons in training. With this pre-surgical planning method, intraoperative morbidity, renal loss, vascular injury, and a need for aortic or vena caval resection could be reduced. Until now, it has not been described as a technique to improve the surgical skill in retroperitoneal surgery. The difference between the proportions test allowed us to confirm that there is a significant difference in the prediction made by the expert surgeon when observing the conventional tomography vs observing the 3D image, the latter being a better tool compared to the former. Our findings show that the radiomic algorithm is more accurate and precise in cases where the post-chemotherapy residual masses are not resectable. To our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the prediction of the resectability of retroperitoneal residual masses. However, there are data concerning the need for adjunctive procedures in PC-RPLND, such as nephrectomy, vascular resection or reconstruction, inferior vena cava resection or repair, aortic replacement, duodenectomy, ureteral repair, etc. [ 15 ]. Johnson and colleagues described that the dominant mass size and degree of circumferential vessel involvement (>135 for the vena cava and >330 for the aorta) predicted resection or reconstruction [ 18 ]. Clinical predictors of the need for additional procedures are risk group, tumor size, final retroperitoneal pathology, and elevated markers [ 16 , 19 ]. We have to keep in mind that PC-RPLND remains a challenging operation with a morbidity of 12% to 32, and 0.8% mortality in experienced specialist centres [ 20 , 21 , 22 ]. The three-dimensional visualization of the anatomical regions that need to be evaluated for a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection allows us to understand and optimize the procedure, better appreciating the anatomy and planning the surgical route to follow, and, so, improve the perioperative outcome and decrease complications. CT rendering with radiomic extraction could help predict the result of the surgery more objectively and not dictated by the operator’s experience or skills alone. That said, we believe that radiomic algorithms have the potential to be a useful tool for predicting surgical outcomes in retroperitoneal surgery. Our findings highlight that an artificial intelligence (AI) model is required in the pre-operative planning of advanced testicular tumors compared to the traditional pre-planning by conventional imaging. Currently, AI models and machine learning models are gaining popularity in the field of urology [ 22 , 23 , 24 ]; our results represent the application of an AI model and the utility of handcrafted radiomics in uro-oncology. There are limitations to our study. The prediction of resectability depended on surgeon experience, although CT rendering with radiomic extraction allowed the safe resection of retroperitoneal tumor. Further, our findings are based on findings from only one institution, and we were not able to externally validate the model. Therefore, this study provides clues but not sufficient evidence to prove that the proposed AI model can help new surgeons predict if a tumor will be resectable or not. A crucial aspect in the case of testicular cancer is the young age of the patients and, consequently, every attempt should be made to provide curative intent in such cases. For this reason, whether an AI model can improve the prediction of tumor resectability needs to be demonstrated unequivocally. We also encourage other research groups to address this issue."

        "content": "While computed tomography allows surgeons to have an overall location of the tumor and could help during surgery planning, CT and segment renderings give us a complete view of the proximity of adjacent vessels and organs. The use of 3D reconstruction adds a more sensitive way of predicting resectability than conventional CT images. By using 3D reconstruction, young surgeons could assess a patient’s preoperative condition, make a surgical strategy, and simulate surgical procedures to ensure a more accurate and safe surgical treatment. The inclusion of radiomic features to build an artificial intelligence model may improve the prediction of resectability in post-chemotherapy RPLND. This tool would be of great support in a teaching hospital, allowing surgery to be planned and complications anticipated, and most importantly, avoiding reaching the point of no return."

    "title": "Diagnostic yield of colonoscopy surveillance in testicular cancer survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy: study protocol of a prospective cross-sectional cohort study",
    "abstract": "Background Testicular cancer (TC) survivors have an increased risk of various second primary malignancies. A recent cohort study detected an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy with a hazard ratio of 3.9. CRC risk increased with higher cisplatin-dose. We know that colonoscopy surveillance in high-risk populations results in reduced incidence and mortality of CRC. TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy can potentially benefit from colonoscopy surveillance; however, to which extent is unknown. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of these secondary CRCs is unknown, and better insights into the carcinogenesis may affect surveillance decisions. Methods This prospective multicenter study will be performed in four Dutch hospitals. TC survivors are eligible if treated with ≥ 3 cycles of cisplatin before age 50. Colonoscopy will be performed ≥ 8 years after initial treatment (minimum and maximum ages at colonoscopy, 35 and 75 years, respectively). The primary aim of the study is the diagnostic yield of advanced neoplasia detected during colonoscopy. As secondary aim, we will evaluate the molecular profile of advanced colorectal neoplasia and will assess current platinum levels in blood and urine and correlate blood-platinum levels with prevalence of colorectal lesions. Furthermore, we will investigate effectiveness of fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) and burden of colonoscopy by two questionnaires. Demographic data, previous history, results of colonoscopy, hemoglobin level of FIT and results of molecular and platinum levels will be obtained. Yield of colonoscopy will be determined by detection rate of adenoma and serrated lesions, advanced adenoma detection rate and CRC detection rate. The MISCAN model will be used for cost-effectiveness analyses of CRC surveillance. With 234 participants undergoing colonoscopy, we can detect an absolute difference of 6% of advanced neoplasia with 80% power. Discussion TC survivors treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy can benefit from CRC surveillance. Evaluation of the diagnostic performance and patient acceptance of CRC surveillance is of importance to develop surveillance recommendations. Insight into the carcinogenesis of cisplatin-related advanced colorectal lesions will contribute to CRC prevention in the increasing number of TC survivors. The results may also be important for the many other cancer survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.

        "section_name": "Background",
        "content": "Due to improved treatment strategies, testicular cancer (TC) survival has strongly increased over the past decades, especially since the introduction of cisplatin-based chemotherapy [ 1 ]. As TC usually is diagnosed at a young age, this high cure rate results in a long life-expectancy [ 2 – 5 ]. Yet, this life-expectancy can be compromised by late adverse treatment effects such as second primary malignancies [ 6 ]. A cohort study detected an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) in TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy with a hazard ratio of 3.9 compared with the general population [ 7 ]. A dose–response relationship between platinum and gastro-intestinal second primary malignancies including CRC has been demonstrated [ 7 ]. An increased risk for gastro-intestinal cancers, mainly CRC, pancreatic and gastric cancer, has also been described in childhood cancer survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy [ 8 ]. Other studies have also reported an increased incidence of CRC following TC treatment with a RR varying between 1.3 and 2.3 compared with the general population [ 9 – 15 ]. The risk of developing CRC remained significantly elevated for a long period after TC treatment with elevated risks reported even after 35 years [ 12 ,  13 ,  16 ]. Therefore we hypothesize that comparable to other high-risk groups for developing CRC, colonoscopy surveillance may be beneficial in the follow-up of TC survivors [ 17 ,  18 ]. Because colonoscopy is an invasive procedure, surveillance by fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) may be a good alternative. FIT is effective and a non-invasive CRC screening strategy, however, effectiveness in high-risk groups is not known. Currently, the pathogenesis of CRC in TC survivors exposed to cisplatin is poorly understood. In several studies, platinum was still detectable in serum and urine up to 20 years after treatment [ 19 – 21 ]. Cisplatin can cause DNA damage by inducing crosslinks. Therefore, CRCs and their precursor lesions in TC survivors may differ histopathologically or molecularly from sporadic CRC. We designed a prospective study to determine the diagnostic yield of advanced neoplasia (advanced adenomas, advanced serrated lesions or CRC) in TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy as these patients have an increased risk for developing CRC. FIT surveillance is non-invasive and may be a good alternative to colonoscopy surveillance. The accuracy of FIT with regard to the detection of advanced neoplasia will be determined. Furthermore, the burden of colonoscopy and cost-effectiveness of different CRC surveillance strategies will be evaluated. Additionally, the level of platinum in plasma and urine and the histopathological and molecular pattern of advanced neoplasia will be assessed. Insight into the pathogenesis and the association with platinum levels may result in a tailored CRC surveillance program for TC survivors."

        "content": "The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic yield of advanced colorectal neoplasia by surveillance colonoscopy in TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Advanced neoplasia is defined as advanced adenoma (high-grade dysplasia, > 25% villous component or ≥ 10 mm), advanced serrated lesion (dysplasia or ≥ 10 mm diameter) or CRC [ 22 ,  23 ]. The secondary objectives are to assess the effectiveness of FIT in detecting advanced neoplasia and to examine patient perception (burden, acceptance and satisfaction). We will evaluate which CRC surveillance strategy (FIT or colonoscopy) is most cost-effective in TC survivors. Furthermore, we will evaluate the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of advanced neoplasia and relate that to platinum level in plasma and urine in TC survivors. This prospective cross-sectional cohort study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Netherlands Cancer Institute (Dutch Trial Registry (NL68513.031.19) and registered at Clinical Trials ( NCT04180033 )) and is currently ongoing. TC survivors will be selected from a well-defined multicentre cohort including 5.848 1-year TC survivors who were treated between 1976 and 2007 [ 7 ]. Inclusion criteria for this study are as follows: (1) treatment of primary TC should have consisted of ≥ 3 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin; (2) diagnosis of TC was made before the age of 50 years; (3) initial treatment for TC administered at least 8 years prior to inclusion; (4) the patients should be at least 35 years of age and not older than 75 years of age and (5) detection and potential treatment of advanced colorectal neoplasia should be considered beneficial, i.e. life-expectancy of at least 5 years. TC survivors are not eligible for participation in this study if they meet one of the following exclusion criteria: a history of proctocolectomy, colonoscopy surveillance for other indications (including hereditary CRC syndrome, familial CRC syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, history of colorectal adenoma or CRC), colonoscopy in the past 3 years, ongoing cytotoxic treatment or radiotherapy for malignant disease, coagulopathy (prothrombin time < 50% of control; partial tromboplastin time > 50 s) or anticoagulants (fenprocoumon, acenocoumarol, or direct oral anticoagulants) or platelet aggregation inhibitors that cannot be stopped or safely bridged if necessary, comorbidity leading to an impaired physical performance (World health organization (WHO) performance status 3–4) or mental retardation, limited Dutch language skills or no informed consent. A total of 1.801 men treated in the four different hospitals in the Netherlands could potentially be eligible. Individuals who do meet the inclusion criteria will be invited for participation in one of the four Dutch study centers (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen and University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht). The flowchart of the design of this study is shown in Fig.  1 . Participants who are eligible for participation will be invited for this study. Referral to the gastroenterology department will occur via the general practitioner or medical oncologist, depending whether the individual is still in follow-up for TC. Informed consent will be concluded by a gastroenterologist or nurse specialist, when the participant was informed adequately. Fig. 1 Flowchart of study. Abbreviations:  FIT  Fecal immunochemical test;  TC  testicular cancer Flowchart of study. Abbreviations:  FIT  Fecal immunochemical test;  TC  testicular cancer For patients who will be excluded due to colonoscopy in the 3 years prior to invitation we will evaluate the yield of colonoscopy retrospectively. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Netherlands Cancer Institute (IRBd19-236). The diagnostic yield of colonoscopy in TC survivors will be compared to the NordICC study. This is a European randomized trial for population-based primary colonoscopy screening for colorectal cancer. Participants were between 55 and 64 years of age and we selected only male participants to compare with our male cohort of TC survivors [ 24 ]. For molecular profiling, data will be compared with existing molecular data of colorectal lesions (mainly polyps) diagnosed in Dutch patients before the age of 70 years [ 25 ]. The power calculation is based on the primary endpoint of this study: the diagnostic yield of advanced colorectal neoplasia by screening colonoscopy. The prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia in the NordICC study population was 10.3% among the 6,493 male participants who underwent colonoscopy screening (based on the most recent data) [ 24 ]. We will use the data from the male participants of the NordICC study aged 55–64 years old and use frequency matching with 5-year strata of the NorcICC male patients to patients in our study. We do believe that colonoscopy surveillance is justified with an increase detection rate of advanced neoplasia adjusted for age of 6%. In order to detect this 6% difference in advanced neoplasia in TC survivors with at least 80% power (using a two-sided alpha of 5%), we need to include at least 234 TC survivors. A margin of 40% will be considered for non-responders and drop-outs based on previous participation rates and therefore 338 men will be approached. An interim analysis will be performed after the inclusion of 100 participants. The bowel preparation will be performed as for routine colonoscopy by ingesting a commonly prescribed oral electrolyte lavage solution. Conscious sedation (with midazolam and/or fentanyl citrate or propofol) and cardiopulmonary monitoring will be used according to standard protocol. The colonoscopy will be performed by experienced gastroenterologists having performed at least 1000 colonoscopies or under direct supervision of an experienced gastroenterologist. When colorectal neoplasia is detected, polypectomy will be performed or biopsies will be obtained according to standard protocol. In case of a polyp ≥ 10 mm, four field biopsies will be taken around the polyp. Additional fresh frozen material of non-neoplastic mucosa will be taken for study purposes from all participants to perform additional molecular analyses (see section histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular pathology). Four biopsies of normal mucosa (fresh frozen) of the transverse colon and two to four biopsies of normal mucosa of the descending colon (fresh frozen) will be taken. An experienced gastro-intestinal pathologist will perform routine histopathological evaluation of colorectal neoplasia. All advanced neoplasia will be requested from all four hospitals and will be re-evaluated by the same pathologist (PS) and.immunohistochemical and molecular analysis will be performed on these advanced lesions. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the MMR proteins (MLH1/MSH2/MSH6 and PMS2) will be performed and DNA will be isolated. A mutational panel (Sequenom Massarray including AKT1, BRAF, DDR2, EGFR, MEK1, PIK2CA, KRAS and NRAS) will be executed. The definite analyses will be based on an ongoing retrospective study on CRC in TC survivors. Biopsies of normal colorectal tissue from the transverse and descending colon will be obtained after informed consent, as previously described. This fresh frozen tissue will be evaluated to further understand the effect of platinum-based chemotherapy on endoscopically normal mucosa. The participant will receive a first questionnaire together with the information about the colonoscopy after informed consent is given, before colonoscopy is performed. This questionnaire will evaluate risk factors for CRC risk (including familial history), quality of life, the physical and mental functioning of the patient and the expected burden of colonoscopy. A second questionnaire will be sent to the participant one week after the colonoscopy. This questionnaire will again assess quality of life, the physical and mental functioning of the patient and will determine the experienced burden of colonoscopy. The questionnaires will include information on the expected/experienced burden, embarrassment and pain of the bowel preparation and the colonoscopy procedure. Patients will receive instructions and the stool test (FIT, FOBgold test) after informed consent. Prior to bowel preparation for the surveillance colonoscopy, patients are asked to collect a stool sample to perform FIT and send the stool kit to the laboratory for processing and analysis. The FIT is a quantitative test and the level of hemoglobin will be detected in µg Hb/g feces. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the curve can be calculated for (advanced) neoplasia with the colonoscopy of the participant as a reference. We will measure the platinum level in a single plasma (6 mL EDTA containing tube) and a urine sample using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A blood and urine sample will be collected on the day of intake or before the colonoscopy. ICP-MS will be performed according to a protocol previously described [ 19 ,  26 ,  27 ]. Cost-effectiveness analysis of colonoscopy surveillance will be evaluated using the microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) model [ 28 ,  29 ]. In this model, the influence of the implementation of a surveillance program (colonoscopy or FIT) will be simulated. This model can estimate the incidence, prevalence and mortality of CRC, and the results and effects of surveillance based on the prevalence of advanced neoplasia detected during this current study and taking to account the mortality risk of TC survivors [ 30 ]. The costs and number of life-years gained for the population with and without the implementation of surveillance will be evaluated. Based on these results, we can make recommendations for CRC surveillance based on the most cost-effective strategy."

        "content": "In this prospective study, TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy will be offered a colonoscopy in order to evaluate the diagnostic yield in detecting advanced neoplasia as we hypothesize that this population benefits from CRC surveillance. This study is currently ongoing and we expect to complete inclusion in June 2022. Colonoscopy reduces the risk of CRC and CRC related mortality [ 31 – 33 ]. CRC screening programs for the general average-risk population have been implemented in many countries [ 24 ,  34 ]. There are different CRC screening modalities including primary colonoscopy screening and fecal occult blood test screening with colonoscopy in case of a positive test result. For high-risk-groups a more intensified surveillance program is recommended, and the interval used differs between the different high-risk-groups [ 18 ,  35 ]. For individuals with a family history of CRC and an estimated increased risk of CRC of 2.5 compared to the general population, colonoscopy surveillance is advised every 5 years from the age of 45 years [ 17 ,  18 ]. During colonoscopy precursor lesions of CRC can directly be removed which has been shown to reduce CRC incidence and mortality in high-risk-groups [ 31 ,  36 – 39 ]. TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy do have a 3.9-fold increased risk. Due to the increased CRC risk, we will evaluate the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy surveillance. The diagnostic yield of advanced neoplasia detected during colonoscopy in TC survivors will be compared to the male population of the NordICC study, which contains males with an average risk for developing CRC [ 24 ]. The participation rate of CRC surveillance is of great importance to benefit as many TC survivors as possible. Currently, most TC survivors are unaware of the increased risk of developing CRC. In a Dutch pilot study with primary colonoscopy screening the participation rate of colonoscopy was only 21% [ 34 ]. On the other hand, colonoscopy participation in a high risk group of familial risk was reported between 40% [ 40 ]. Therefore, FIT surveillance should be considered, as FIT is less invasive than colonoscopy and therefore could increase the participation rate in CRC surveillance. There are already studies showing that FIT surveillance may be beneficial in different risk groups for CRC by choosing a low cut-off [ 41 ]. However, in familial colorectal cancer and other patients with an increased risk of CRC, the accuracy of FIT is unknown. In high-risk-groups for developing CRC, colonoscopy surveillance has been shown to be cost-effective [ 42 ,  43 ]. The MISCAN model will be adapted by specific CRC risk data and competing mortality risk data of TC survivors. We will than evaluate the CEA of both colonoscopy and FIT screening at different cut-off levels. This will result in an advise for further surveillance in TC survivors. We hypothesize that the carcinogenesis of (the precursor lesions of) CRC in TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy differs from sporadic CRC. It is known that cisplatin can induce cytotoxicity through the formation of DNA crosslinks due to covalent bonds between purines [ 44 – 51 ]. The analysis which will be performed on the tissue obtained from this study will depend on an ongoing retrospective study where the histopathological and molecular characteristics of CRC diagnosed in TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy will be evaluated (data not yet published). Finally, level of platinum in plasma will be determined in order to see if there is correlation between the level of platinum in plasma and the presence of (advanced) neoplasia detected during the colonoscopy. It is unknown whether persisting retention of platinum adducts in plasma correlate with the increased risk of advanced neoplasia [ 19 ,  20 ]. Furthermore, urine platinum level will be evaluated as cisplatin is renally excreted, and was also detected 17 years after platinum treatment [ 7 ]. Maybe platinum levels in plasma and urine may guide indication for colonoscopy surveillance. This protocol describes a prospective cross-sectional cohort study where we will evaluate the diagnostic yield of advanced neoplasia in TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Furthermore, we will evaluate the effectiveness of FIT, patient acceptance and burden of colonoscopy and also the most cost-effective CRC surveillance strategy. Additionally, we aim to gain insights into the pathogenesis of CRC in TC survivors which includes determining platinum levels in plasma and urine. Through this study we aim to provide CRC surveillance recommendations. This knowledge may also be of guidance for other cancer survivors who have received platinum-based chemotherapy for other types of malignancies."

    "title": "Transient effects of chemotherapy for testicular cancer on mouse behaviour",
    "abstract": "The treatment of testicular cancer includes unilateral orchiectomy and chemotherapy and is curative for most patients. However, observational studies revealed an association with depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment. It is unclear whether these side effects are caused by chemotherapy, hemicastration or the disease itself. The aim of our study was to analyse the behavioural effects of hemicastration and chemotherapy in adult male mice. The animals were randomly divided into four groups – control, chemotherapy, hemicastration and hemicastration with chemotherapy. After chemotherapy that included three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin mice underwent a battery of behavioural tests. To assess the long-term effects animals were tested also 3 months after the end of treatment. Chemotherapy led to lower locomotor- and exploratory activity, higher anxiety-like behaviour and worse spatial memory immediately after treatment. These behavioural effects were not present three months later. Hemicastration had no effect on most of the observed outcomes. In conclusion, adverse behavioural effects induced by chemotherapy in mice are transient and disappear later in life. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the observed effects.",

        "content": "Testicular cancer primarily affects young men at reproductive age 1 . Nowadays, testicular cancer is highly curable due to advances in treatment for testicular cancer 2 , 3 . Primary surgery (orchiectomy) followed by three to four cycles of multiagent chemotherapy (bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin) has been considered as the standard first-line treatment of metastatic testicular cancer 4 . Despite high efficacy of this type of testicular cancer treatment, its adverse effects on quality of life were also reported. Besides deleterious effect of chemotherapy on reproductive function of men 5 , 6 , adverse behavioural effects including higher levels of anxiety and depression 7 , 8 , fatigue and cognitive impairment 9 – 11  were also indicated. Clinical studies suggest that the mentioned adverse effects of chemotherapy are long-lasting – higher anxiety and depression are present even 11 years following the chemotherapy treatment 12 , 13 . Amidi  et al . 9  have observed cognitive impairment (impaired working memory, visual learning and memory, executive functioning, verbal learning and memory, processing speed) in testicular cancer patients 2–7 years following treatment. Chovanec  et al . 14  have reported a decrease in overall cognitive function score (sum of four subscales: perceived cognitive impairment and cognitive abilities, quality of life affected by cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment perceived by others) in patients 5–32 years following chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment 15 . On the contrary, some studies have brought different results 16 , 17  indicating the need to study the effects in controlled experimental conditions. Animal studies have shown gonadotoxic effects of chemotherapy for testicular cancer on the morphology and function of male rat reproductive system 18 , 19 , however, animal studies dealing with effects of multiagent chemotherapy on behaviour are still lacking. In addition, the behavioural effect of partial or compensated hypogonadism in clinical or experimental studies with or without chemotherapy has not been studied yet. Although multiagent chemotherapy is very effective, it is not clear, whether adverse behavioural effects are due to chemotherapy, orchiectomy or cancer itself. To the best of our knowledge, no experimental studies have analyzed the effect of therapeutically relevant doses of chemotherapy on complex behavioural phenotype of mice. In this view, the aim of the present study was to describe behavioural effects of hemicastration and multiagent chemotherapy used for the treatment of testicular cancer in mice. In addition, long-term effects of multiagent chemotherapy were observed."

Two-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of treatment (F 1,51  = 17, p < 0.001) but not surgery approach (F 1,51  = 0.002, p = 0.97). The interaction between these two factors was statistically not significant (F 1,51  = 0.04, p = 0.85, Fig.  2 ).

Anxiety-like behaviour was observed in open field and elevated plus maze test. In open field test, two-way ANOVA indicated a main effect of treatment (F 1,51  = 12.0, p < 0.01) but not surgery approach (F 1,51  = 2.13, p = 0.15) on time spent in centre zone of the open field arena. The interaction between these two factors was statistically not significant (F 1,51  = 0.18, p = 0.68, Fig.  3a ). Bonferroni corrected post hoc test showed that BEP mice spent less time in centre zone than CTRL mice (t 51  = 2.78, p < 0.05, Fig.  3a ), an effect seen only in SHAM operated group (Fig.  3a ). Similarly, a main effect of treatment (F 1,51  = 11.1, p < 0.01) without a significant effect of surgery approach (F 1,51  = 0.88, p = 0.35) was revealed using two-way ANOVA on number of entries into centre zone. The interaction between these two factors was statistically not significant (F 1,51  = 0.49, p = 0.49, Fig.  3b ). Bonferroni corrected post hoc test indicated that BEP mice entered the centre zone of the open field less frequently compared to CTRL mice (t 51  = 2.88, p < 0.05, Fig.  3b ).

In elevated plus maze test, there was no statistically significant effect observed when looking at treatment, surgery approach or their interaction on time spent in open arms [treatment: (F 1,51  = 0.72, p = 0.40), surgery approach: (F 1,51  = 0.58, p = 0.45), interaction: (F 1,51  = 0.002, p = 0.96), Fig.  3c ]. A main effect of surgery approach (F 1,51  = 4.94, p < 0.05) without a significant effect of treatment (F 1,51  = 0.11, p = 0.74) was observed in the number of open arm entries. The interaction between surgery approach and treatment was not significant (F 1,51  = 0.04, p = 0.95, Fig.  3d ). Following the Bonferroni post-hoc correction, no significant differences were observed between groups (Fig.  3c,d ). There were no significant differences in general activity of mice measured as number of closed arm entries in the elevated plus maze test (effect of treatment: F 1,51  = 0.28, p = 0.60, surgery approach: F 1,51  = 0.65, p = 0.42, treatment x surgery interaction: F 1,51  = 0.41, p = 0.52, (Fig.  3e ). In the first trial of the novel object recognition test, a main effect of treatment (F 1,51  = 7.45, p < 0.01) and surgery approach (F 1,51  = 6.37, p < 0.05) on total exploratory activity of mice was observed. The interaction between these two factors was significant (F 1,51  = 5.58, p < 0.05, Fig.  4a ). Bonferroni post-hoc correction showed that BEP mice spent less time interacting with objects compared to CTRL mice (t 51  = 3.64, p < 0.01, Fig.  4a ). In the first trial of the test, hGDX mice spent less time with exploring objects than CTRL mice (t 51  = 3.42, p < 0.01, Fig.  4a ).

Similarly, in the second trial, a significant effect of treatment (F 1,51  = 13.4, p < 0.001) but not surgery approach (F 1,51  = 0.39, p = 0.54) on total exploratory activity was observed. The interaction between these factors (F 1,51  = 2.93, p = 0.09, Fig.  4b ) was not statistically significant. Following the Bonferroni post-hoc correction, BEP mice spent less time interacting with objects compared to CTRL mice (t 51  = 3.83, p < 0.01, Fig.  4b ). In addition, the absolute time difference between investigating the sample and novel object was calculated in the second trial. There was no statistically significant effect observed when looking at treatment (F 1,51  = 0.92, p = 0.34) and surgery approach (F 1,51  = 3.07, p = 0.09). The interaction between these factors was significant (F 1,51  = 4.61, p < 0.05). Following the Bonferroni post-hoc correction, no significant differences were observed between groups (Fig.  4c ). In the second trial of the T maze test, a main effect of treatment (F 1,51  = 4.54, p < 0.05) but not surgery approach (F 1,51  = 0.84, p = 0.37) on time exploring the newly unblocked arm was detected. The interaction between these two factors was significant (F 1,51  = 4.84, p < 0.05, Fig.  5a ). Bonferroni corrected post hoc test showed that BEP mice spent less time exploring the newly unblocked arm compared to CTRL mice (t 51  = 3.09, p < 0.05, Fig.  5a ), an effect observed only in SHAM group of animals.

Similarly, a main effect of treatment (F 1,51  = 15.9, p < 0.001) without a significant effect of surgery approach (F 1,51  = 0.002, p = 0.96) was revealed using two-way ANOVA on number of entries into previously blocked arm. The interaction between these two factors was statistically not significant (F 1,51  = 1.06, p = 0.31, Fig.  5b ). Bonferroni corrected post hoc test indicated that BEP mice entered the previously blocked arm less frequently compared to CTRL mice (t 51  = 3.58, p < 0.01, Fig.  5b ). No significant difference between the treatment groups was found in time spent immobile using two-way ANOVA [treatment (F 1,51  = 1.15, p = 0.29), surgery approach (F 1,51  = 0.03, p = 0.87), interaction (F 1,51  = 4.91, p = 0.05), Fig.  6a ] and time spent with climbing [treatment (F 1,51  = 0.30, p = 0.59), surgery approach (F 1,51  = 0.38, p = 0.54), interaction (F 1,51  = 0.44, p = 0.51), Fig.  6b ]. Regarding time spent with swimming (Fig.  6c ), two-way ANOVA revealed a significant treatment x surgery approach interaction (F 1,51  = 6.27, p < 0.05), while no main effect of either treatment (F 1,51  = 1.27, p = 0.27) or surgery approach (F 1,51  = 0.19, p = 0.67) on this type of behaviour was observed.

        "content": "The link between testicular cancer treatment and decline in quality of life including anxiety, depression, fatigue and cognitive difficulties is evident from clinical observational studies in testicular cancer survivors 7 – 10 , 14 . However, it is unclear whether these adverse behavioural effects are caused by chemotherapy, hemicastration or by the treated cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of hemicastration and multiagent chemotherapy used for the treatment of testicular cancer in adult male mice. Administration of bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin chemotherapy led to lower locomotor- and exploratory activity, higher anxiety-like behaviour and worse spatial memory in mice tested after the end of the third cycle of the treatment. However, chemotherapy did not affect depression-like behaviour of mice and more importantly, the observed adverse behavioural effects were not detected three months later. Experimental groups of mice displayed similar general activity in the elevated plus maze test and also equal swim speed in the Morris water maze test, suggesting that the observed behavioural effects are indeed direct effects of chemotherapy. Thus, anxiety-like behaviour was not affected by motor impairment. On contrary, we can speculate that chemotherapy-induced increase of anxiety-like behaviour could affect the exploratory and locomotor activity 20 , 21 . Our results are in consensus with findings of previous animal studies reporting lower locomotor activity 22 , 23 , higher anxiety-like behaviour 24  and impaired memory 24 , 25  following chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced higher depression-like behaviour was reported by Iarkov  et al . 25 , however, this effect of chemotherapy was not confirmed in our study. In comparison to our study, all of the aforementioned studies differ in methodological details including species and type of chemotherapeutics used, and also dosing, timing and regimen of chemotherapy exposure. Moreover, previously published studies e.g 22 , 24 , 25 . observed mainly the short-term effect of chemotherapy on animal behaviour, thus, our study is the first dealing with both, short- and long-term behavioural effects of multiagent chemotherapy. Hemicastration did not affect most of the observed outcomes. Animal studies dealing with the behavioural effects of the most efficient multiagent chemotherapy in humans (co-administration of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin) are lacking. The only experimental study conducted on rats is the study of Kilarkaje  et al . 19  investigating the effect of multiagent chemotherapy on fertility and not on behaviour of the rats. To the best of our knowledge, our experiment is the first study investigating the effects of this type of chemotherapy on mouse behaviour. Animal models that appropriately mimic human testicular cancer treatment are extremely important. Furthermore, an experimental study allows investigation of the effect of chemotherapy and hemicastration on behaviour of mice separately, which is not possible in humans. Regarding the present study, several strengths should be pointed out. In our study, hemicastration of mice was performed to mimic surgical part of the treatment of testicular carcinoma in humans. Subsequently, the mice received multiagent chemotherapy according to the protocol widely used for treating human testicular cancer patients. In addition, to mimic clinical heterogenity present in clinical practice, outbred strain (CD-1) of mice was used. The animals underwent a comprehensive phenotyping using a battery of behavioural tests. However, there are several inherent limitations of this study. The animals were healthy, without any testicular tumours that might also affect observed behavioural outcomes. In 75% of testicular cancer patients after unilateral orchiectomy a so-called compensated hypogonadism with normal concentration of testosterone and elevated concentration of luteinizing hormone can be found 26 . A technical limitation of the present experiment is the lack of luteinizing hormone measurement after hemicastration, thus the confirmation of compensated hypogonadism in mice. In the present study, hemicastration and the likely induced compensated hypogonadism did not affect most of behavioural outcomes. Another limitation of our study may be a lack of use of antiemetic prophylaxis in experimental animals that is routinely used in testicular cancer patients. Such treatment may also modulate cognitive functions during and immediately after chemotherapy. In contrast to patients, in mice, the chemotherapeutic drugs are administered intraperitoneally. The route of administration could affect the pharmacokinetics and, thus, the results of the present study. It is, however, an integral limitation of all animal studies. This study shows that chemotherapy affects the behaviour temporarily and does not cause any long-term behavioural disturbances in mice. Data from observational studies in testicular cancer survivors show worsened cognition immediately after chemotherapy and a subsequent return to normal after one year of follow up 27 – 29 . However, cognitive impairment was found again 7–10 years after chemotherapy 9 , 11 , 30 . Thus, we speculate that after a short-term normalization a long-term decrease of cognitive functioning would be found in mice as well. This must be proved in further longer studies. In addition, further research is needed to investigate the possible role of luteinizing hormone and the involved molecular mechanisms of the behavioural effects to identify possible therapeutic targets in testicular cancer survivors. In conclusion, adverse behavioural effects induced by chemotherapy in mice were transient and disappeared later in life. Additional longer and more detailed studies are needed to elucidate the possible mechanisms in the long-term adverse behavioural effects of chemotherapy."

        "content": "In the present study, CD1 mice (n = 60) were used. Young male mice (6-weeks old, Velaz, Prague, Czech Republic) were group-housed (3–5 per cage) throughout the study in polycarbonate cages (36.5 × 20.5 × 14 cm) and maintained in a temperature- (22 ± 2 °C) and humidity-controlled room (55 ± 10%) with 12:12 h light/dark schedule. Mice had access to standard food and water  ad libitum . All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institute of Molecular Biomedicine, Comenius University, Bratislava and have been conducted in accordance with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU, and Slovak legislation. Adult male mice were randomly divided into four groups: control (CTRL, n = 15), chemotherapy (BEP, n = 15), hemicastration (hGDX, n = 15) and hemicastration with chemotherapy (hGDX + BEP, n = 15). At 8 weeks of age, hGDX mice underwent unilateral gonadectomy under xylazine (intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg, Xylariem inj, Riemser, Germany) and ketamine (intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg, Narkamon inj, Bioveta, Czech Republic) anaesthesia. In hGDX mice, either right or left testis (cauda and caput epididymis) was extracted through a small incision made at the posterior tip of the scrotum. The vas deferens and spermatic blood vessels were ligated with a silk suture. Control mice were sham operated, where either right or left testis was gently removed from and then replaced into the scrotum. After surgery, mice were group-housed with their previous cage mates and had access to food and water  ad libitum . The schematic representation of the experimental design is shown in Fig.  1 . After a two-week recovery period, intraperitoneal application of chemotherapy was started. Experimental animals were treated with three cycles (21 days each) of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) dissolved in saline according to the protocol of Kilarkaje  et al . 19 . Briefly, bleomycin was injected on days 2, 9 and 16; while etoposide and cisplatin on days 1–5 of the given cycle. Control animals received saline. At the end of the third cycle mice underwent a battery of behavioural tests assessing locomotor and exploratory activity, anxiety- and depression-like behaviour and memory. To evaluate potential late onset effects of chemotherapy, the animals underwent the same battery of behavioural tests 3 months after the end of treatment. The open field arena consisted of a square arena (45 cm × 45 cm). The arena was virtually divided into two zones, the central zone and border zone. Mice were placed into the centre of the arena and were allowed to freely explore it for 5 min. To evaluate locomotor activity, total distance moved was observed. Parameters like the frequency of entrances and time spent in the centre zone were considered as anti-anxiety behaviour 31 . The novel object recognition task was conducted in the open field arena. The test had two sessions (5 min each) with retention interval of 1 hour. In this task, three different objects were used: 1. a standard plastic bottle, 2. a metallic can and 3. glass bottle. During the first session, the mice were placed in the middle of arena with two objects (plastic and metallic bottle) positioned at the opposite corners of the arena (27 cm from the wall and 55 cm apart of each other). Time spent exploring the object 1 or 2 was marked as “a1” or “a2”. During the second session, the plastic bottle was left in the arena (time “a3”) and the metallic can was replaced with a novel object (glass bottle, time “b”). Exploration was defined as sniffing or licking the objects. Total time exploring both objects during the first and second sessions (session 1: e1 = a1 + a2, session 2: e2 = a3 + b) and the absolute time difference between investigating the familiar and the novel object (session 2: d1 = b − a3) were recorded 32 . The elevated plus maze apparatus consisted of four arms: two open without walls (45 cm × 10 cm) and two closed (45 cm × 10 cm) with 40 cm high walls. The four arms were extended from a central platform (10 cm × 10 cm). Each arm of the apparatus was attached to metal legs elevating the maze to a height of 50 cm above the floor. Mice were placed at the end of the open arm facing from the maze and were allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min. The time spent in open arms and the number of open arm entries was considered to be indicators of anti-anxiety-like behaviour 33 . In addition, the number of closed arm entries was evaluated as an index of general activity 34 . The T-maze apparatus consisted of three arms, including long arm (base: 10 cm × 40 cm × 20 cm) and two arms (10 cm × 30 cm × 20 cm) extending from the long arm of the maze. Spatial recognition memory was assessed using two-trial (5 min each) T-maze. The mice were started from the base of the T maze. In the first trial, one of the three arms was closed and mice had free access to explore two open arms during 5 min testing period. The retention interval was 30 min between the trials. During the second trial, all three arms of the maze were opened allowing the exploration of each arm for 5 min. To eliminate side preference, the position of the blocked arm was systematically altered between the animals. The observed parameter was the amount of time spent exploring and number of entries to the newly unblocked arm during the first two minutes of the second trial as an indicator of spatial recognition memory 35 . Mice were individually placed into a transparent plastic cylinder (height 45 cm, diameter 30 cm) filled with tap water (23–25 °C). The time of immobility was recorded during 6 min testing period as an index of depression-like behaviour. Two additional parameters – time spent with swimming and climbing (escaping) were also evaluated. Due to the fact, that mice are very active at the beginning of the test, the first two minutes of the test was considered as habituation period and only the last four minutes of the test were analyzed 36 . The Morris water maze consisted of a dark plastic circular pool (height 60 cm, diameter 125 cm) filled with water (25 ± 1 °C). The pool was virtually divided into four quadrants marked with intra-maze geometric cues (circle, square, triangle and star) inside the maze wall for orientation and spatial learning. A hidden circular platform (1 cm beneath the water surface) was placed in one of the four quadrants. The position of hidden platform (10 cm in diameter) remained unchanged during the 4-day acquisition period. The mice underwent four trials per day, always starting from a different quadrant. The order of the release positions was fixed during the acquisition phase of testing. One trial consisted of a swim, with up to 60 s duration, followed by a 30 s rest on the platform. If the mouse did not find the platform within 60 s, it was gently guided by an investigator to climb on platform. In acquisition period, escape latency (time to find the hidden platform) was calculated for each day to evaluate short-term working memory. On the 5 th  day of testing, a probe trial was performed. The platform was removed and the mice were allowed to swim for 60 s. The release position was in the quadrant opposite to the platform-quadrant. The time spent in platform-quadrant was recorded as an indicator of long-term reference memory 37 . To assess whether mice in the groups are comparable in their ability to swim and in motivation to escape, mean swim velocity was calculated for each day of Morris water maze testing. In this study, we have focused on spatial learning ability (hippocampal function-dependent) of mice that is why we did not perform the visual platform learning trials assessing non-spatial learning ability (independent of hippocampal function) of animals. In addition, mice underwent Morris water maze testing only once, three months following the chemotherapy treatment to assess long-term effect of chemotherapy or castration without bias due to previous training/learning effects on spatial memory in the Morris water maze. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA). To analyze the behaviour of mice, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, independent factors: treatment and surgery approach) with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc t-test was used. P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data are presented as mean plus standard error of the mean (SEM)."

Mice were placed at the end of the open arm facing from the maze and were allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min. The time spent in open arms and the number of open arm entries was considered to be indicators of anti-anxiety-like behaviour 33 .

Spatial recognition memory was assessed using two-trial (5 min each) T-maze. The mice were started from the base of the T maze. In the first trial, one of the three arms was closed and mice had free access to explore two open arms during 5 min testing period. The retention interval was 30 min between the trials. During the second trial, all three arms of the maze were opened allowing the exploration of each arm for 5 min. To eliminate side preference, the position of the blocked arm was systematically altered between the animals. The observed parameter was the amount of time spent exploring and number of entries to the newly unblocked arm during the first two minutes of the second trial as an indicator of spatial recognition memory 35 ."

The pool was virtually divided into four quadrants marked with intra-maze geometric cues (circle, square, triangle and star) inside the maze wall for orientation and spatial learning. A hidden circular platform (1 cm beneath the water surface) was placed in one of the four quadrants. The position of hidden platform (10 cm in diameter) remained unchanged during the 4-day acquisition period. The mice underwent four trials per day, always starting from a different quadrant. The order of the release positions was fixed during the acquisition phase of testing. One trial consisted of a swim, with up to 60 s duration, followed by a 30 s rest on the platform. If the mouse did not find the platform within 60 s, it was gently guided by an investigator to climb on platform. In acquisition period, escape latency (time to find the hidden platform) was calculated for each day to evaluate short-term working memory. On the 5 th  day of testing, a probe trial was performed. The platform was removed and the mice were allowed to swim for 60 s. The release position was in the quadrant opposite to the platform-quadrant. The time spent in platform-quadrant was recorded as an indicator of long-term reference memory 37 . To assess whether mice in the groups are comparable in their ability to swim and in motivation to escape, mean swim velocity was calculated for each day of Morris water maze testing. In this study, we have focused on spatial learning ability (hippocampal function-dependent) of mice that is why we did not perform the visual platform learning trials assessing non-spatial learning ability (independent of hippocampal function) of animals. In addition, mice underwent Morris water maze testing only once, three months following the chemotherapy treatment to assess long-term effect of chemotherapy or castration without bias due to previous training/learning effects on spatial memory in the Morris water maze."

    "abstract": "Genetic variation may mediate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in chemotherapy-treated testicular cancer (TC) patients compared to the general population. Involved single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might differ from known CVD-associated SNPs in the general population. We performed an explorative genome-wide association study (GWAS) in TC patients. TC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy between 1977 and 2011, age ≤55 years at diagnosis, and ≥3 years relapse-free follow-up were genotyped. Association between SNPs and CVD occurrence during treatment or follow-up was analyzed. Data-driven Expression Prioritized Integration for Complex Trait (DEPICT) provided insight into enriched gene sets, i.e., biological themes. During a median follow-up of 11 years (range 3–37), CVD occurred in 53 (14%) of 375 genotyped patients. Based on 179 SNPs associated at  p  ≤ 0.001, 141 independent genomic loci associated with CVD occurrence. Subsequent, DEPICT found ten biological themes, with the RAC2/RAC3 network (linked to endothelial activation) as the most prominent theme. Biology of this network was illustrated in a TC cohort ( n  = 60) by increased circulating endothelial cells during chemotherapy. In conclusion, the ten observed biological themes highlight possible pathways involved in CVD in chemotherapy-treated TC patients. Insight in the genetic susceptibility to CVD in TC patients can aid future intervention strategies.",

        "section_name": "Introduction",
        "content": "Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common malignancy in men between 20 and 40 years of age. Over 80% of patients with metastatic TC is cured with platinum-based chemotherapy [ 1 ]. Consequently, the number of TC survivors steadily increases. High cure rates come at the trade-off of increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), attributed to chemotherapy. Compared to age-matched controls, patients treated with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin chemotherapy have a hazard ratio for coronary artery disease of 5.7 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.9–17.1), and for atherosclerotic disease of 4.7 (95% CI, 1.8–12.2) [ 2 ]. Moreover, cardiovascular mortality is increased after chemotherapy for TC with a standardized mortality ratio of 1.36 (95% CI, 1.03–1.78) [ 3 ]. In these relatively young men, the burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to chemotherapy is an important determinant of long-term outcome. Genetic variation is thought to mediate in part the increased risk of CVD in chemotherapy-treated TC patients. However, involved single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might differ from the currently known SNPs associated with increased risk of CVD in the general population. A limited number of studies reported on associations between SNPs and late complications of TC treatment. These studies mostly focused on SNPs in specific genes rather than using unbiased genome-wide approaches. SNPs in the glutathione S-transferase genes GSTP1 and GSTM3 have been associated with neurotoxicity and ototoxicity in platinum-treated TC patients [ 4 – 6 ]. SNPs in the 5-α-reductase type II (SRD5A2) gene were associated with prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in TC survivors after platinum-based chemotherapy [ 7 ]. This finding, however, could not be replicated [ 8 ]. A recent study in 188 platinum-treated TC patients reported that a SNP in solute carrier gene SLC16A5 was associated with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity [ 9 ]. In the Platinum Study cohort of 511 TC survivors, a SNP in the Wolframin ER transmembrane glycoprotein (WFS1) was associated with ototoxicity [ 10 ]. To date, however, genetic variation has not been investigated in relation to CVD after TC treatment. As with the reported associations between SNPs and neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and the metabolic syndrome, insight in genetic variation and biological pathways associated with cardiovascular toxicity may help to estimate the increased risk for CVD and to guide preventive cardiovascular intervention strategies in TC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. We performed an exploratory genome-wide association study (GWAS) in TC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy to gain insight into the SNPs underlying susceptibility to CVD in this population."

        "content": "Patients were selected from the institutional data-biobank on TC patients treated at the University Medical Center Groningen between 1977 and 2011. Inclusion criteria were (a) advanced seminoma or non-seminoma TC, Royal Marsden Hospital stage II, III, or IV, (b) treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, (c) age ≤55 years at diagnosis, (d) ≥3 years relapse-free follow-up after start of first-line chemotherapy, or after second-line chemotherapy if given for early relapse within 3 years after TC diagnosis, (e) no chemotherapy or malignancy prior to TC, and (f) no CVD prior to TC. The phenotype endpoint of the GWAS was the occurrence of a cardiovascular event during treatment or follow-up, defined as any (1) coronary disease (myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome), (2) cerebrovascular infarction or transient ischemic attack, (3) cardiomyopathy or heart failure, (4) thromboembolic event (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, venous access port-associated), (5) peripheral artery disease, or (6) other cardiovascular events (e.g., intracerebral hemorrhage, cardiac arrhythmia, or cardiac valve regurgitation or stenosis). Follow-up data were available through several prospective TC studies and medical records. Follow-up was censored in case of late relapse (more than 3 years after chemotherapy), except for teratoma treated by surgery alone. In addition, follow-up was censored in case of second malignancy, except for non-melanoma skin cancer. Study protocols were approved by the medical ethical review committee of the University Medical Center Groningen (ethical protocol code 2006/041), performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and each participant gave written informed consent. Germline DNA was isolated from blood using a standard phenol-chloroform method or using the NucleoSpin Blood XL column (Macherey-Nagel, BIOKÉ, Leiden, The Netherlands). SNP array was performed according to suppliers’ protocol using an Illumina HumanCytoSNP-12 v2.1 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, California, US) covering 298,563 SNPs. SNPs were called using Illumina GenomeStudio v2011.1 (Genotyping v1.9.4; Illumina Genome Viewer v1.9.0) and then exported (PLINK Input Report Plug-in v2.1.3 for GenomeStudio Software). Quality analysis was performed using PLINK 1.07, filtering out (1) SNPs with a call rate <95%, (2) samples with a SNP call rate <95%, (3) samples with mismatch between reported and predicted sex, (4) SNPs that have minor allele frequency <5%, and (5) samples with significant deviation from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium ( p  < 0.0001) [ 11 ]. Association between SNPs and the occurrence of CVD was assessed in PLINK by chi-squared test using the max(T) permutation procedure with 25,000 permutations. SNPs were clumped into independently associated loci based on linkage disequilibrium, using an empirical  p  ≤ 0.001 as a threshold for association of index SNPs (PLINK parameters: --clump-p1 0.001 --clump-p2 0.01 --clump-r2 0.20 --clump-kb 500). The loci found in the association analysis were annotated with genes known to be associated with these loci using the following three methods. First, we determined the nearest gene(s) for each SNP as reported in dbSNP build 150. Second, based on a publicly available large-scale mapping of  cis  and  trans  expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in blood we determined for each SNP if that SNP has been reported to affect the expression of any gene [ 12 ]. Third, the SNPs found in the association analysis were used as input for the Data-driven Expression Prioritized Integration for Complex Trait (DEPICT) framework [ 13 ]. At the core of DEPICT, genes are functionally characterized by their membership probabilities across 14,461 gene sets. DEPICT takes genes in loci associated with the input SNPs and uses the shared gene set memberships of those genes to prioritize genes that have similar predicted functions. Genes were reported by HGNC gene symbol if possible (retrieved using R/Bioconductor package biomaRt 2.32.1), or alternatively by Ensemble identifiers. Next, gene set enrichment analysis was performed to gain insight in the biology underlying the associations between SNPs and the occurrence of CVD. To this end, DEPICT takes genes in loci associated with the input SNPs, and tests which of its 14,461 gene sets are enriched in those genes, at a threshold of nominal  p  < 0.001. Since DEPICT is based on reconstituted gene sets of known molecular pathways from various sources, overlap between the reconstituted gene sets can be expected. Therefore, the enriched gene sets were clustered into ‘biological themes’ using affinity propagation as described next. The enriched gene sets were extracted from DEPICT resource file containing the gene-gene set matrix of  z -scores for 19,987 genes. Next, pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between all enriched gene sets, and similar gene sets were clustered into biological themes using affinity propagation clustering (using R package apcluster 1.4.4) [ 14 ]. Affinity propagation finds exemplar gene sets within the input gene sets that are representative for each of the clusters, and names the clusters after their exemplar gene set. As stated by the authors of DEPICT, the reconstituted gene sets should be interpreted in light of the genes that are mapped to them, since their identifiers are simply carried over from the predefined gene sets used in the development of DEPICT [ 13 ]. For the biological themes, we addressed this issue by renaming the biological theme, if necessary, after examining the main genes within each biological theme (determined by the absolute weighted mean  z -score for each gene in the biological theme, using the multiplicative inverse of the nominal p of each gene set as a weight for each  z -score). As a measure of cancer treatment-induced endothelial activation, the number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) were measured in 60 patients with metastatic TC before and during three consecutive cycles of chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) using the CellSearch CEC Kit (Menarini Silicon Biosystems, Huntingdon Valley, PA, USA) according to the supplier’s protocol [ 15 ]. In short, blood was collected in Cell Save Preservative tubes, and CECs were immunomagnetically enriched targeting CD146 followed by staining of the enriched cell population for CD45, CD105, and DAPI. The CD146 enriched cells were classified as CECs when CD105+/CD45−DAPI+ cells."

HW equilibrium: Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Baseline patient and treatment characteristics and clinical follow-up data ( n  = 375). Characteristics of TC patients with and without cardiovascular event were compared with Fisher’s exact test and Mann–Whitney U test after removal of missing values, with two-sided  p  < 0.05 considered significant. BEP  bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin,  BMI  body-mass index,  CEB  carboplatin, etoposide, bleomycin,  eGFR  estimated glomerular filtration rate,  EP  etoposide, cisplatin,  HDL  high density lipoprotein,  IGCCCG  International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group,  LDL  low-density lipoprotein,  PV  cisplatin, vinblastine,  PVB  cisplatin, vinblastine, bleomycin. a Patients with multiple cardiovascular events were counted in multiple categories. b Intracerebral hemorrhage ( n  = 1), cardiac arrhythmia ( n  = 2), and cardiac valve regurgitation or stenosis ( n  = 2). In total, 179 SNPs were associated at  p  ≤ 0.001 with the occurrence of any CVD during or after chemotherapy (Table  S1 ). Clumping based on linkage disequilibrium resulted in 141 independent loci containing a total of 324 SNPs. These 141 loci and corresponding SNPs were annotated by finding nearest gene(s),  cis  or  trans  eQTLs, or DEPICT gene prioritization (Table  2 ). Since DEPICT only includes autosomal loci that do not overlap with the major histocompatibility complex region, gene prioritization resulted in 187 genes mapped to 129 loci. Table 2 For the 141 identified candidate loci, related genes were found by proximity,  cis  or  trans  eQTLs, or by gene prioritization in DEPICT.

Next, gene set enrichment analysis was performed in DEPICT to gain insight in the biology underlying the associations between SNPs and CVD, resulting in 33 gene sets ( p  < 0.001, Table  S2 ). These 33 gene sets were subsequently clustered into ten distinct gene set clusters to highlight the biological themes that are underlying the associations between SNPs and CVD in chemotherapy-treated TC patients (Fig.  2  and Table  S3 ). These biological themes included the RAC2/RAC3 network, metabolism and adiposity, immune response, and caspase cascade/apoptosis. Fig. 2 The 33 gene sets that were enriched according to DEPICT were clustered into ten biological themes. The reconstituted gene sets were named after the predefined gene sets used in the development of DEPICT, and source databases are reported in brackets. The nominal enrichment  p  for each reconstituted gene set as reported by DEPICT is reported in brackets, with emphasis added for gene sets with  p  < 1 × 10 −4 .

Since the most enriched gene sets were the RAC2 and RAC3 subnetworks, clustered as the RAC2/RAC3 network, we explored a biological readout of this finding. RAC2 and RAC3 have been implicated in endothelial activation and dysfunction [ 16 ,  17 ]. Therefore, as a measure of endothelial activation, the number of CECs were measured over time in 60 patients with metastatic TC treated with chemotherapy. A significant increase in CECs during three consecutive cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy was observed (Fig.  3 ). Fig. 3 The number of CECs rises during three cycles of BEP chemotherapy, based on measurements in 665 blood samples in 60 TC patients. Depicted are ( a ) the mean number of CECs per patient during each cycle, and ( b ) all CEC measurements with a LOESS curve. During the three consecutive cycles of chemotherapy the mean number of CECs per patient were median 32/ml (interquartile range, IQR 24–50), 58/ml (IQR 35–91), and 82/ml (20–117), respectively. Compared to the first cycle, the mean number of CECs was increased in the second and third cycle of chemotherapy (Wilcoxon signed rank test  p  < 0.001).

        "content": "In this explorative GWAS using a contemporary strategy in TC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, we determined which SNPs were associated with the occurrence of CVD after start of chemotherapy in these patients. Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis resulted in ten biological themes that highlight pathways that may be involved in the occurrence of CVD in chemotherapy-treated TC patients. These themes include the RAC2/RAC3 network, metabolism and adiposity, immune response, and caspase cascade/apoptosis. Of special interest is the RAC2/RAC3 network that was identified as a prominent biological theme. Several recent reports link RAC2 and RAC3 to chemotherapy toxicity. Rac2 deficiency protected Rac2−/− mice from bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and resulted in lower mortality compared to wildtype mice [ 18 ]. In a rat model, differential Rac2 methylation was found in animals with acute lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide compared to controls [ 19 ]. Although bleomycin-induced pneumonitis was not the endpoint of the current GWAS, it is a well-known side-effect of bleomycin in TC patients that originates from endothelial activation and is linked to endothelial dysfunction [ 20 ,  21 ]. Indeed, RAC2 has been implicated in endothelial activation and neovascularization, as well as leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell [ 16 ,  22 ]. In an atherosclerosis model, Rac2 prevented plaque calcification by suppressing macrophage IL-1β expression. Furthermore, decreased RAC2 expression and increased IL-1β expression were found in calcified coronary arteries from patients [ 23 ]. Rac1/2 pathways were involved in vascular injury in diabetic mice [ 24 ]. RAC3 has been suggested to inhibit senescence, and RAC3 expression is involved in the inflammatory response after TNF stimulation [ 25 ,  26 ]. Moreover, Rac3 modifies the induction of endothelial dysfunction by oxidized low-density lipoprotein in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [ 17 ]. Thus, the RAC2/RAC3 network may play a role in atherosclerosis and senescence—pathophysiologic processes that have been implicated in the progress of CVD in TC patients—as well as bleomycin-induced pneumonitis. Interestingly, SNPs in RAC2 have also been found associated to cardiotoxicity due to anthracycline chemotherapy, suggesting that the RAC2/RAC3 network is a common denominator in cardiovascular toxicity of multiple chemotherapeutic agents [ 27 ]. The occurrence of pathophysiological processes in which the RAC2/RAC3 network is involved, is illustrated in a cohort of 60 TC patients with the observation that the number of CECs increases during consecutive cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy as sign of endothelial activation. The biological themes of metabolism and adiposity, immune response, and caspase cascade/apoptosis are of particular interest, because these processes have been linked in literature to cardiovascular toxicity of platinum chemotherapy. The role of metabolism, adiposity, and endocrine dysfunction in the development of CVD has been well described in TC patients [ 28 – 30 ]. Besides this, the role of inflammation and immune response has been established in murine and cell models of platinum-induced nephrotoxicity, evidenced by upregulation of TNF-α and a direct mediating role of T lymphocytes [ 31 – 35 ]. The biological theme involving caspase activation and apoptosis is illustrated by murine and in vitro experiments indicating the role of caspase 1 and caspase 3 in platinum-induced nephrotoxicity, as well as endothelial cell apoptosis in response to cisplatin administration [ 20 ,  36 ,  37 ]. The low absolute incidence of TC and of CVD in chemotherapy-treated TC patients poses a challenge to perform meaningful GWAS on toxicity. Therefore, the current exploratory GWAS aimed to find relevant gene sets and possible biological themes rather than specific SNPs. To this end, the study was designed to minimize type II statistical errors whilst accepting a higher probability of type I statistical errors: in the trade-off between false positives and negatives, we avoided false negatives. Consequently, the current study should be regarded as hypothesis-generating and the highlighted biological themes should be regarded as providing a promising base for future studies on genetic susceptibility and relevant biomarkers in CVD in TC patients. In this regard, results from the ongoing trials on genetic variation in TC survivors in relation to renal and cardiovascular toxicity ( NCT02303015 ), as well as ototoxicity and neurotoxicity ( NCT02890030 ,  NCT02677727 ) are awaited. The need to study SNPs associated with CVD in the specific population of TC patients derives from the notion that involved SNPs might differ from the currently known SNPs associated with increased risk of CVD in the general population. Indeed, only two of the 179 SNPs associated with CVD in the current GWAS were recorded to be associated with any cardiovascular phenotype in the NHGRI-EBI Catalog of published GWAS (catalog release 11 December 2017): rs2130392 and rs6773957 were associated with Kawasaki syndrome and adiponectin levels, respectively [ 38 ]. Nevertheless, future research should not only aim at exploring and validating results from genetic studies in TC cohorts, such as the biological themes highlighted in the current analysis, but also investigate the value of genetic risk scores derived from CVD GWAS in the general population. The major strengths of this GWAS are the well-defined cohort, the completeness of follow-up, and the clinical relevance of addressing susceptibility to CVD in TC patients. Two additional remarks should be made on the study design. First, a broad definition of CVD (both venous and arterial) was used to define cases, because a stricter definition of only arterial events would unwarrantably compromise statistical power. Second, as we included patients treated from 1977 to 2011, follow-up duration varied widely, although selection bias in this regard may be considered unlikely given only a 1 year longer median follow-up duration for the cases compared to the control group, and equal ranges of follow-up duration for both groups."

The biology of the RAC network was illustrated by observed CEC induction as sign of endothelial activation during consecutive courses of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in a TC cohort. Insight in the genetic variants determining susceptibility to CVD in TC patients can aid in the development of intervention strategies to prevent long-term sequelae of chemotherapy in often young cancer survivors."

    "title": "Comprehensive Characterization of the Vascular Effects of Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy in Patients With Testicular Cancer",
    "abstract": "Background Cisplatin-based chemotherapy increases the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease. Objectives We aimed to define the time course, pathophysiology, and approaches to prevent cardiovascular disease associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Methods Two cohorts of patients with a history of testicular cancer (n = 53) were recruited. Cohort 1 consisted of 27 men undergoing treatment with: 1) surveillance; 2) 1 to 2 cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy (low-intensity cisplatin); or 3) 3 to 4 cycles of BEP (high-intensity cisplatin). Endothelial function (percentage flow-mediated dilatation) and cardiovascular biomarkers were assessed at 6 visits over 9 months. Cohort 2 consisted of 26 men previously treated 1 to 7 years ago with surveillance or 3 to 4 cycles BEP. Vasomotor and fibrinolytic responses to bradykinin, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside were evaluated using forearm venous occlusion plethysmography. Results In cohort 1, the percentage flow-mediated dilatation decreased 24 h after the first cisplatin dose in patients managed with 3 to 4 cycles BEP (10.9 ± 0.9 vs. 16.7 ± 1.6; p < 0.01) but was unchanged from baseline thereafter. Six weeks after starting 3 to 4 cycles BEP, there were increased serum cholesterol levels (7.2 ± 0.5 mmol/l vs. 5.5 ± 0.2 mmol/l; p = 0.01), hemoglobin A1c (41.8 ± 2.0 mmol/l vs. 35.5 ± 1.2 mmol/l; p < 0.001), von Willebrand factor antigen (62.4 ± 5.4 mmol/l vs. 45.2 ± 2.8 mmol/l; p = 0.048) and cystatin C (0.91 ± 0.07 mmol/l vs. 0.65 ± 0.09 mmol/l; p < 0.01). In cohort 2, intra-arterial bradykinin, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside caused dose-dependent vasodilation (p < 0.0001). Vasomotor responses, endogenous fibrinolytic factor release, and cardiovascular biomarkers were not different in patients managed with 3 to 4 cycles of BEP versus surveillance. Conclusions Cisplatin-based chemotherapy induces acute and transient endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and nephrotoxicity in the early phases of treatment. Cardiovascular and renal protective strategies should target the early perichemotherapy period.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Patients were recruited from the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre between January 2016 and July 2017. Inclusion criteria included diagnosis of testicular/retroperitoneal germ cell cancer with orchidectomy ≤8 weeks prior and scheduled for cisplatin-based chemotherapy or surveillance. Participants were categorized into 3 groups: 1) surveillance; 2) 1 to 2 cycles BEP; or 3) 3 to 4 cycles BEP. Exclusion criteria included: carboplatin treatment; age <18 or >65 years; clinical trial participation; antiplatelet/lipid-lowering therapy; recreational drug use; inflammatory/infective/autoimmune disease; another malignancy in the previous 5 years; previous thrombosis; and inability to provide informed consent. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens included BEP or etoposide and cisplatin (EP). Each treatment cycle lasted 21 days, with cisplatin administered on days 1 and 2 (cisplatin dose 50 mg/m 2 /day) or days 1 to 5 (cisplatin dose 20 mg/m 2 /day), such that the cumulative dose of cisplatin in each cycle of treatment was 100 mg/m 2 . Patients attended outpatient bleomycin administration on days 8 and 15 (each dose 30,000 IU). Patients were treated with etoposide 165 mg/m 2  on days 1 to 3 if receiving 1, 3, or 4 cycles of BEP; or etoposide 120 mg/m 2  on days 1 to 3 if receiving 2 cycles of BEP. Patients with stage 1 disease received 1 to 2 cycles of BEP, a low-intensity cisplatin regimen. Patients with metastatic disease received 3 or 4 cycles of BEP, a high-intensity cisplatin regimen. Patients with metastatic disease or with a contraindication to bleomycin received 4 cycles of EP, with cisplatin administered over days 1 to 5 (cisplatin dose 20 mg/m 2 /day) to achieve cumulative cisplatin dose 100 mg/m 2 . All patients received hydration containing potassium and magnesium before and after each cisplatin dose. Initial assessments were performed ≤8 weeks after orchidectomy and ≤2 weeks pre-chemotherapy. In patients managed with surveillance, subsequent assessments were 1 to 2 weeks, 6 weeks ± 3 days, 3 months ± 1 week, 6 months ± 1 week, and 9 months ± 1 week after the initial assessment. In patients managed with chemotherapy, subsequent assessments were within 24 h of cisplatin administration and 6 weeks ± 3 days, 3 months ± 1 week, 6 months ± 1 week and 9 months ± 1 week ( Figure 1 ). Participants fasted (with the exception of water) for 8 h and abstained from exercise, caffeine, and tobacco for 4 h before each assessment. Height, weight, and blood pressure (BP) were assessed at each visit. Figure 1 Cancer Management Regimes and Assessments in Cohort 1 (Early Effects Study) Patients with a recent diagnosis of testicular/retroperitoneal germ cell cancer and orchidectomy ≤8 weeks prior scheduled for cisplatin-based chemotherapy or active surveillance were recruited. Participants were stratified into 3 groups by management: 1) active surveillance for stage 1 low-risk disease; 2) 1 to 2 cycles of adjuvant bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy for stage 1 high-risk disease; or 3) 3 to 4 cycles BEP chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  Red circles  illustrate study assessments. Cancer Management Regimes and Assessments in Cohort 1 (Early Effects Study) Patients with a recent diagnosis of testicular/retroperitoneal germ cell cancer and orchidectomy ≤8 weeks prior scheduled for cisplatin-based chemotherapy or active surveillance were recruited. Participants were stratified into 3 groups by management: 1) active surveillance for stage 1 low-risk disease; 2) 1 to 2 cycles of adjuvant bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy for stage 1 high-risk disease; or 3) 3 to 4 cycles BEP chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  Red circles  illustrate study assessments. The primary outcome was change in endothelial function relative to baseline, assessed using the AngioDefender system (Everist Genomics, Ann Arbor, Michigan). This portable device allows bedside assessment of endothelial vasomotor function. It calculates percentage flow-mediated dilatation (%FMD) using a proprietary algorithm deriving changes in brachial artery diameter from pulse wave amplitude data before and after brachial artery occlusion with an upper arm cuff ( 13 ). Maximal post-occlusion change in brachial artery diameter relative to baseline is calculated and expressed as %FMD. The repeatability of AngioDefender %FMD is similar to traditional brachial artery ultrasound (BAUSS) assessment of %FMD (coefficient of variation 25.9% and 25.1%, respectively, according to personal communication with investigative teams (Everist Health, March 2015) for  NCT02641197  and  NCT02682576 . AngioDefender quantification of %FMD is similar to BAUSS (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r p  = 0.75; p < 0.0001) and correlates more strongly with 10-year Framingham risk score (r p  = −0.38; p < 0.001 AngioDefender; r p  = −0.24; p = 0.03 BAUSS) ( 14 ). Fasting venous blood was collected at each visit. Serum creatinine, lipid profile, glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C), and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) were measured in the local clinical laboratory. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation ( 15 ). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to measure serum tissue plasminogen activator (Asserachrom, Stago, Reading, United Kingdom), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (Asserachrom), von Willebrand factor (vWF) (Asserachrom), and intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (Quantikine, R&D Systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom). Cystatin-C was measured using a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (Tina-quant, Roche, Germany). Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and lipoprotein(a) were measured (Roche c311 analyzer) and high-sensitivity troponin-I was measured (Abbot, Architect i1000SR). Urine was collected for assessment of interleukin (IL)-18 (Quantikine, R&D Systems). Testicular cancer survivors age 18 to 50 years managed with 3 to 4 cycles of BEP or active surveillance 1 to 7 years previously were recruited. Exclusion criteria included ongoing clinical trial participation; vascular disease; asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; diabetes; atrial fibrillation/flutter; anticoagulation; tobacco/recreational drug use; inflammatory, infectious, or autoimmune disease; another malignancy within 7 years; and prior thrombosis. Studies were performed with the patient supine in a quiet, temperature-controlled room. Participants fasted for 4 h, abstained from alcohol for 24 h, and did not consume medications for 3 days before each study. Bilateral venous cannulae were inserted into large antecubital fossa veins for venous sampling. Brachial artery cannulation was performed using a 27-standard-wire-gauge steel needle for intra-arterial administration of locally active doses of drugs. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured in the infused and noninfused arms by venous occlusion plethysmography. Supine heart rate (HR) and BP were monitored ( 12 , 16 ). Pharmaceutical-grade bradykinin (BK) (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland), acetylcholine (ACh) (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, London, United Kingdom), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (UL Medicines, Surrey, United Kingdom) were dissolved in physiological saline. BK is an endothelium-dependent vasodilator that provokes endothelial release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). ACh is an endothelium-dependent vasodilator that does not provoke t-PA release. SNP is an endothelium-independent vasodilator. The primary outcome was change in BK-induced vasodilation. Secondary outcomes were change in ACh- and SNP-induced vasodilation, BK-induced tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 release, and between-group differences in cardiovascular biomarkers. After a 20-min intra-arterial 0.9% saline infusion, participants received ascending doses of BK (100, 300, and 1,000 pmol/min), ACh (5, 10, and 20 μg/min), and SNP (2, 4, and 8 μg/min) for 6 min at each dose, with a 20-min 0.9% saline washout between agents. The infusion rate was maintained at 1 ml/min and the infusion order was randomized for each volunteer. Venous blood was collected at baseline for lipid profile, HbA1C, vWF antigen, and ICAM-1 concentration (Vacuette, Kremsmünster, Austria). Full blood count, renal function, liver function, lipid profile, glucose, and HbA1C concentrations were measured in local clinical laboratories. Blood samples were simultaneously drawn from each arm at the end of equilibration and each BK dose into acidified buffered citrate (TriniLIZE Stabilyte, Co., Wicklow, Ireland) for t-PA assays and citrate (Vacuette) for analysis of PAI-1 (the major endogenous inhibitor of t-PA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed as described in the previous text to determine concentrations of t-PA antigen, PAI-1 antigen, vWF and ICAM-1, and PAI-1 activity (2B Scientific, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom). HAECs (Life Technologies, Paisley, United Kingdom) were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) supplemented with 15 ml SupplementMix (Promocell) and penicillin/streptomycin 50 μg/ml. Confluent cells were rendered quiescent by serum starvation for 2 h in low-serum medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were stimulated with cisplatin (1, 3, or 15 μg/ml) (Accord Healthcare, Devon, United Kingdom) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) for 5 min, 15 min, and 24 h. HAECs were homogenized in lysis buffer and proteins (30 μg) were separated by electrophoresis as described previously ( 17 ). Membranes were probed with antiphosphorylated Akt (Cell Signalling [Danvers, Massachusetts] 4060, 1:1,000) and antiphosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK 1/2) (Cell Signalling 9101, 1:1,000). Protein phosphorylation levels were normalized to α-tubulin (Abcam ab4074, 1:1,0000) and expressed as percentage of the respective time point control, which was taken as 100%. mRNA expression of t-PA (QT00075761, Qiagen, Manchester, United Kingdom) and PAI-1 (QT00062496, Qiagen) was assessed by qPCR. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Qiagen) as previously described ( 17 ). Data are expressed as target gene/GAPDH housekeeping gene (Sense: GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT; Anti-Sense: TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG; Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany). Relative gene expression was calculated by the 2 -ΔΔCt  method, and results were compared with control. Data were analyzed using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures based on the general linear model and Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons. Power calculations determined that, at a significance of 5%, 10 subjects/group would provide 90% power of detecting 1.6% difference in %FMD between visits by paired Student’s  t -test with SD of paired difference of 1.4 ( 13 ). Serum lipoprotein(a), urine ACR, and urine IL-18 (adjusted for urine creatinine concentration) were logarithmically transformed to ensure normality. Forearm plethysmographic data were analyzed as described previously ( 18 ). Net t-PA and PAI-1 release were defined as the product of the infused forearm plasma flow and the concentration difference between infused and noninfused arms ( 18 ). Previous studies demonstrated that 8 subjects per group provides sufficient power to detect an approximately 20% change in FBF at 5% significance ( 19 , 20 ). The influence of a range of factors on FBF responses have been reported in similar sample sizes ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ). Analysis was by repeated measures based on the general linear model or 1-way ANOVA. Data were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons (Western Blot analyses) or unpaired Student’s  t -test (mRNA expression). Relative mRNA expression values were logarithmically transformed to ensure normality. Variables are reported as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California) with statistical significance at 5%."

Inclusion criteria included diagnosis of testicular/retroperitoneal germ cell cancer with orchidectomy ≤8 weeks prior and scheduled for cisplatin-based chemotherapy or surveillance. Participants were categorized into 3 groups: 1) surveillance; 2) 1 to 2 cycles BEP; or 3) 3 to 4 cycles BEP. Exclusion criteria included: carboplatin treatment; age <18 or >65 years; clinical trial participation; antiplatelet/lipid-lowering therapy; recreational drug use; inflammatory/infective/autoimmune disease; another malignancy in the previous 5 years; previous thrombosis; and inability to provide informed consent. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens included BEP or etoposide and cisplatin (EP). Each treatment cycle lasted 21 days, with cisplatin administered on days 1 and 2 (cisplatin dose 50 mg/m 2 /day) or days 1 to 5 (cisplatin dose 20 mg/m 2 /day), such that the cumulative dose of cisplatin in each cycle of treatment was 100 mg/m 2 . Patients attended outpatient bleomycin administration on days 8 and 15 (each dose 30,000 IU). Patients were treated with etoposide 165 mg/m 2  on days 1 to 3 if receiving 1, 3, or 4 cycles of BEP; or etoposide 120 mg/m 2  on days 1 to 3 if receiving 2 cycles of BEP. Patients with stage 1 disease received 1 to 2 cycles of BEP, a low-intensity cisplatin regimen. Patients with metastatic disease received 3 or 4 cycles of BEP, a high-intensity cisplatin regimen. Patients with metastatic disease or with a contraindication to bleomycin received 4 cycles of EP, with cisplatin administered over days 1 to 5 (cisplatin dose 20 mg/m 2 /day) to achieve cumulative cisplatin dose 100 mg/m 2 . All patients received hydration containing potassium and magnesium before and after each cisplatin dose. Initial assessments were performed ≤8 weeks after orchidectomy and ≤2 weeks pre-chemotherapy. In patients managed with surveillance, subsequent assessments were 1 to 2 weeks, 6 weeks ± 3 days, 3 months ± 1 week, 6 months ± 1 week, and 9 months ± 1 week after the initial assessment. In patients managed with chemotherapy, subsequent assessments were within 24 h of cisplatin administration and 6 weeks ± 3 days, 3 months ± 1 week, 6 months ± 1 week and 9 months ± 1 week ( Figure 1 ). Participants fasted (with the exception of water) for 8 h and abstained from exercise, caffeine, and tobacco for 4 h before each assessment.

Figure 1 Cancer Management Regimes and Assessments in Cohort 1 (Early Effects Study) Patients with a recent diagnosis of testicular/retroperitoneal germ cell cancer and orchidectomy ≤8 weeks prior scheduled for cisplatin-based chemotherapy or active surveillance were recruited.

Red circles  illustrate study assessments. The primary outcome was change in endothelial function relative to baseline, assessed using the AngioDefender system (Everist Genomics, Ann Arbor, Michigan). This portable device allows bedside assessment of endothelial vasomotor function. It calculates percentage flow-mediated dilatation (%FMD) using a proprietary algorithm deriving changes in brachial artery diameter from pulse wave amplitude data before and after brachial artery occlusion with an upper arm cuff ( 13 ). Maximal post-occlusion change in brachial artery diameter relative to baseline is calculated and expressed as %FMD. The repeatability of AngioDefender %FMD is similar to traditional brachial artery ultrasound (BAUSS) assessment of %FMD (coefficient of variation 25.9% and 25.1%, respectively, according to personal communication with investigative teams (Everist Health, March 2015) for  NCT02641197  and  NCT02682576 . AngioDefender quantification of %FMD is similar to BAUSS (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r p  = 0.75; p < 0.0001) and correlates more strongly with 10-year Framingham risk score (r p  = −0.38; p < 0.001 AngioDefender; r p  = −0.24; p = 0.03 BAUSS) ( 14 ). Fasting venous blood was collected at each visit. Serum creatinine, lipid profile, glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C), and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) were measured in the local clinical laboratory. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation ( 15 ). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to measure serum tissue plasminogen activator (Asserachrom, Stago, Reading, United Kingdom), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (Asserachrom), von Willebrand factor (vWF) (Asserachrom), and intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (Quantikine, R&D Systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom). Cystatin-C was measured using a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (Tina-quant, Roche, Germany). Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and lipoprotein(a) were measured (Roche c311 analyzer) and high-sensitivity troponin-I was measured (Abbot, Architect i1000SR). Urine was collected for assessment of interleukin (IL)-18 (Quantikine, R&D Systems)."

Exclusion criteria included ongoing clinical trial participation; vascular disease; asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; diabetes; atrial fibrillation/flutter; anticoagulation; tobacco/recreational drug use; inflammatory, infectious, or autoimmune disease; another malignancy within 7 years; and prior thrombosis. Studies were performed with the patient supine in a quiet, temperature-controlled room. Participants fasted for 4 h, abstained from alcohol for 24 h, and did not consume medications for 3 days before each study. Bilateral venous cannulae were inserted into large antecubital fossa veins for venous sampling. Brachial artery cannulation was performed using a 27-standard-wire-gauge steel needle for intra-arterial administration of locally active doses of drugs. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured in the infused and noninfused arms by venous occlusion plethysmography. Supine heart rate (HR) and BP were monitored ( 12 , 16 ). Pharmaceutical-grade bradykinin (BK) (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland), acetylcholine (ACh) (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, London, United Kingdom), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (UL Medicines, Surrey, United Kingdom) were dissolved in physiological saline. BK is an endothelium-dependent vasodilator that provokes endothelial release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). ACh is an endothelium-dependent vasodilator that does not provoke t-PA release. SNP is an endothelium-independent vasodilator. The primary outcome was change in BK-induced vasodilation. Secondary outcomes were change in ACh- and SNP-induced vasodilation, BK-induced tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 release, and between-group differences in cardiovascular biomarkers. After a 20-min intra-arterial 0.9% saline infusion, participants received ascending doses of BK (100, 300, and 1,000 pmol/min), ACh (5, 10, and 20 μg/min), and SNP (2, 4, and 8 μg/min) for 6 min at each dose, with a 20-min 0.9% saline washout between agents.

In patients managed with 3 to 4 cycles of BEP, serum cholesterol increased at 6 weeks (7.2 ± 0.5 mmol/l vs. 5.5 ± 0.2 mmol/l at baseline; p = 0.012) ( Table 2 ). This remained numerically greater than baseline thereafter, but was not statistically significant. There were trends toward increased triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients managed with 3 to 4 cycles of BEP (p = 0.076 and p = 0.079 vs. baseline). This pattern was not seen in the other groups. Serum fasting glucose increased within 24 h in patients managed with 1 to 2 or 3 to 4 cycles of BEP (both p < 0.0001 vs. baseline), but did not change in patients managed with surveillance. There was a rise in HbA1c in the patients receiving 3 to 4 cycles of BEP at 6 weeks (p < 0.001), but thereafter it was not elevated versus baseline. vWF antigen increased at 6 weeks versus baseline in the 3 to 4 cycles of BEP group (p = 0.048) but was not different from baseline at any other time point or in any other group. High sensitivity troponin-I, ICAM-1, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were unchanged throughout ( Table 2 ). In patients managed with 3 to 4 cycles of BEP, urine ACR increased at 24 h and 6 weeks (p = 0.011 and p = 0.014) and returned to baseline thereafter ( Figure 3 ). Urine IL-18 increased at 24 h (p = 0.023) and returned to baseline by 6 weeks. Serum cystatin C increased at 24 h (p = 0.012) and 6 weeks (p = 0.004) and returned to baseline thereafter. eGFR was unchanged throughout ( Figure 3 ). Urine ACR and IL-18 increased 24 h after 1 to 2 cycles of BEP (p = 0.038 and p = 0.039) and returned to baseline by 6 weeks. There were no other significant changes in this group or patients managed with surveillance.

        "content": "Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is associated with endothelial vasomotor dysfunction, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and renal dysfunction in testicular cancer patients ( Central Illustration ). These effects are confined to the immediate perichemotherapy period. Our observations suggest the early time period post-cisplatin treatment is one that is potentially of increased renal and cardiovascular risk, and one during which attention should be given to risk reduction with cardiovascular protection strategies. Central Illustration Effects of Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy on Endothelial Function Patients with testicular cancer managed with cisplatin-based chemotherapy or surveillance were enrolled. Endothelial function was assessed by % flow-mediated dilatation over 9 months in patients with a recent diagnosis, or venous occlusion plethysmography in patients managed 1 to 7 years previously. Acute and transient endothelial dysfunction was observed 24 h after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and endothelial function was not impaired 1 to 7 years after treatment. In the  left panel , the  blue and red shaded rectangles  refer to duration of chemotherapy treatment ( solid blue  = 1 cycle,  light blue  = 2 cycles;  solid red  = 3 cycles,  light red  4 = cycles).

Shaded areas  indicate chemotherapy. ∗∗p < 0.01. A strength of the study is the early assessment of endothelial vasomotor function within 24 h following chemotherapy. Prior studies evaluating vascular function after cisplatin-based chemotherapy are limited by infrequent assessments performed months or years following treatment ( 6 , 9 ), potentially missing the period of maximum vascular injury and dysfunction. We demonstrate that, following 3 to 4 cycles of BEP, endothelial function is impaired at this acute and vulnerable time. Although endothelial function returned to baseline values at the subsequent 6-week assessment, it is biologically plausible that a similar transient deterioration in endothelial function is induced with each treatment cycle ( 5 ). Endothelial dysfunction is a key feature in de novo thrombosis and rupture of pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque ( 25 ). As such, it is an important component to the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events in the early period following cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In our cell-based study, exposure of HAECs to cisplatin was associated with decreased t-PA mRNA expression and activation of Akt and ERK 1/2. In previous work, cisplatin has been shown to reduce endothelial cell survival and induce apoptosis in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) ( 26 ) and in the vasa nervorum in rats ( 27 ). These data support the hypothesis that cisplatin induces direct endothelial toxic effects resulting in increased stress kinase signaling and a propensity for thrombosis via reduction in the capacity for endogenous fibrinolysis. Although adverse thrombotic effects are most frequently observed in the early period following chemotherapy, cisplatin is detectable in serum for several years after treatment ( 28 ). This chronic exposure may provoke low-grade endothelial stimulation and a consequent pro-atherogenic environment ( 28 , 29 ). Our subsequent assessment was with forearm venous occlusion plethysmography, the gold standard for assessing endothelial function ( 12 ). In patients treated 1 to 7 years previously, there was no difference in endothelial vasomotor function between patients managed with orchidectomy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus those managed with orchidectomy alone. Furthermore, BK-induced t-PA release was not different in patients managed with or without cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The capacity for endothelial t-PA release is a sensitive, and mechanistically relevant, marker for the prediction of patients at risk of cardiovascular events ( 30 ). Serum cholesterol and HbA1C increased transiently at 6 weeks after 3 to 4 cycles of BEP and similar trends were seen for LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy may have contributed to these observations, we cannot conclude that this is the only explanation. Indeed, a reduction in tumor burden may have contributed to increases in cholesterol ( 31 ). Furthermore, glucocorticoid antiemetics may have contributed to changes in lipid profile and glycemia. However, we do not believe glucocorticoids are the sole explanation for the change in lipid parameters. Indeed, in a randomized study in which dexamethasone or placebo were given to healthy male volunteers, dexamethasone did not affect endothelial function, triglycerides, or LDL cholesterol, albeit with a different dexamethasone regimen to our study ( 32 ). Most studies evaluating the risk of CVD after cisplatin-based chemotherapy have focused on the later period after treatment ( 3 , 8 , 33 , 34 ). In the 10 to 19 years following treatment, a 5- to 7-fold increased risk of CVD has been reported compared with patients managed with surveillance or the general population ( 8 , 33 ). Larger studies of up to 2,700 patients demonstrate a more modest 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of CVD at 10 to 18 years after treatment ( 3 , 34 ). However, the incidence of thrombosis appears to be highest early after treatment. Between 9% and 11% have a thrombotic event within 1 year following 3 or more cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy ( 9 , 35 ). Importantly, a more granular assessment of 15,006 patients revealed a 5-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death in the first year after treatment. This risk fell dramatically thereafter and was not significant after 1 year ( 1 ). Therefore, in keeping with our observations, the early period after treatment with 3 or more cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy appears to be the time period of increased cardiovascular risk. While these effects predominantly occur in the early period after treatment, cisplatin is detectable in serum several years after treatment ( 28 ). It remains possible that chronic exposure to low levels of cisplatin may cause low-grade endothelial stimulation that contributes to the pathophysiology underlying cardiovascular events occurring more than a decade after initial exposure ( 8 , 28 ). Nephrotoxicity is a major, dose-limiting side effect of cisplatin that affects 20% to 40% of patients ( 4 , 36 ). We found evidence of early nephrotoxicity following 3 to 4 cycles of BEP as illustrated by increased serum cystatin C ( 37 ). Importantly, this returned to baseline by 3 months and, although there was an absolute decrease in eGFR, the change in this less-sensitive measure did not reach statistical significance. Increased urinary ACR in the immediate period following chemotherapy supports the hypothesis that cisplatin induces renovascular endothelial and proximal tubular dysfunction and inflammation as evidenced by the rise in urinary IL-18 ( 4 , 36 , 38 ). We hypothesize that this profile of renal injury is compatible with widespread endothelial activation and injury. To our knowledge this is one of the most comprehensive, longitudinal evaluations of changes in vascular and renal function after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. However, there are some limitations that should be acknowledged. The number of patients in cohort 1 is small, particularly the group managed with 1 to 2 cycles of BEP, and it is not possible to conclude whether associations in this group did not reach statistical significance because of reduced power or because greater cancer burden potentiates the toxic effect of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Furthermore, we did not adjust for potential confounders that may have contributed, such as the baseline elevated BMI in all groups, acute hyperglycemia perhaps due to steroids, and an acute inflammatory response to tumor cell death. Vascular function was assessed using different approaches in the acute and long-term studies. The use of portable equipment allowed assessment of endothelial function at the patient’s bedside in the immediate post-chemotherapy period. We reserved the use of forearm venous occlusion plethysmography for studies in survivors after 1 year. These techniques primarily examine function at different levels of the arterial tree, and we accept this as a limitation. We did not use forearm venous occlusion plethysmography to assess the early vascular effects of cisplatin because this requires arterial cannulation in the context of a potentially pro-thrombotic state and is impractical in the peri-chemotherapy period. Serial assessment of %FMD each day during chemotherapy provides insight to the duration of effects from cisplatin on endothelial function; it would be helpful to assess %FMD in the period at least 1 year after treatment, but we limited assessments to maximize recruitment and retention of patients undergoing intensive treatment regimes. Although AngioDefender %FMD correlates with Framingham risk score ( 14 ), it has not been demonstrated that AngioDefender %FMD is independently predictive of cardiovascular risk. Although we demonstrate deleterious effects of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the early phase that are not evident in the medium-term, these findings could be further strengthened by the inclusion of a larger number of participants and the assessment of survivors treated >7 years previously. Heightened risk of CVD is reported up to 20 years after cisplatin-based chemotherapy ( 8 ), although endothelial function has not been assessed beyond 7 years after treatment, and it remains possible that endothelial dysfunction is also detectable in longer-term survivors."

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK:  The early period following cisplatin-based chemotherapy may be an important window for surveillance and aggressive management of cardiovascular and renal health. Early preventive strategies, including those with statins and antithrombotic therapies, should be further investigated in patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy to mitigate cardiovascular risk in the long-term.

    "title": "Associations of Body Fat Distribution and Cardiometabolic Risk of Testicular Cancer Survivors After Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background It is unknown how body fat distribution modulates the cardiometabolic risk of testicular cancer survivors after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Methods For 455 patients enrolled in the Platinum Study at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue was quantified on prechemotherapy computed tomography. The VAT-to-SAT ratio was calculated as a quantitative measure of central adiposity. Endpoints were incidence of new posthemotherapy cardiometabolic disease (new antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, or diabetes medication), and postchemotherapy Framingham risk scores. Cox models and linear regression with interaction terms were applied. Postchemotherapy body fat distribution was analyzed in 108 patients. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Results The baseline median age was 31 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 26-39 years), body mass index (BMI) was 26 kg/m 2  (IQR = 24-29 kg/m 2 ), and the VAT-to-SAT ratio was 0.49 (IQR = 0.31-0.75). The median follow-up was 26 months (IQR = 16-59 months). Higher prechemotherapy VAT-to-SAT ratios inferred a higher likelihood of new cardiometabolic disease among patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m 2  or greater (age-adjusted hazard ratio = 3.14, 95% confidence interval = 1.02 to 9.71,  P  = .047), but not other BMI groups. The prechemotherapy VAT-to-SAT ratio was associated with postchemotherapy Framingham risk scores in univariate regression analysis (exp(β)-estimate: 2.10, 95% confidence interval = 1.84 to 2.39,  P  < .001); in a multivariable model, this association was stronger in younger vs older individuals. BMI increased in most patients after chemotherapy and correlated with increases in the VAT-to-SAT ratio (Spearman  r  = 0.39,  P  < .001). Conclusions In testicular cancer survivors, central adiposity is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, particularly in obese or young men. Weight gain after chemotherapy occurs preferentially in the visceral compartment, providing insight into the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in this population.",

The Platinum Study is a multicenter prospective clinical investigation of long-term morbidities among cisplatin-treated TCSs in 8 centers in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom ( 13 ). Platinum Study eligibility criteria were previously described ( 14 , 15 ), but briefly included age 18 years and older, cancer diagnosis before age 55 years, male gender, first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy completed at least 6 months before enrollment, no subsequent salvage chemotherapy, and no radiation or previous chemotherapy. Of the 639 patients, 455 (71.2%) had an abdominal CT within 8 weeks before chemotherapy initiation available at MSKCC and were eligible for further study (see  Figure 1 ). The MSKCC Internal Review Board approved the study, and all patients provided written informed consent for medical record access. Study flow chart. BMI = body mass index; CT = computed tomography; max. = maximum; min. = minimum; MSKCC = Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; SAT = subcutaneous adipose tissue, SBP = systolic blood pressure; VAT = visceral adipose tissue. All participants completed a questionnaire at least 6 months postchemotherapy that included adverse health outcomes, lifestyle behaviors, and prescription medication use, as previously detailed ( 13 ). At this time, participants also underwent a physical exam, including height, weight, and systolic blood pressure (SBP). For the current analysis, clinical data at chemotherapy initiation (ie, regimen, weight, SBP, comorbidities, prescription drugs) were extracted from the medical record and/or from the Platinum Study questionnaire. CT scans were analyzed with commercially available software (Aquarius iNtuition version 4.4.13.; Tera Recon, Foster City, CA, USA). Visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue areas (CT density range: −195 to −45 Hounsfield units) were semiautomatically extracted in the transverse plane at the L3/4 intervertebral level. This methodology was based on evidence from the Framingham Heart Study that 2-dimensional measurements at L3/4 most strongly correlate with abdominal fat volumes and cardiometabolic risk ( 16 ). The VAT-to-SAT ratio was calculated as a quantitative measure of central adiposity, with higher ratios indicating greater central adiposity. As a reference, the median VAT-to-SAT ratio of male patients (mean age ± SD = 49.5 ± 10.6 years) in an analysis from the Framingham Heart Study was reported to be 0.84 (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.64-1.10) ( 17 ). The primary study endpoint was new-onset CMD after chemotherapy completion, defined as emergence of any of the following between the end of chemotherapy and Platinum Study questionnaire completion: 1) arterial hypertension, 2) dyslipidemia, and 3) type 2 diabetes (ie, composite cardiometabolic endpoint). Diagnosis of each comorbidity required self-reporting of new prescription medication use for treatment. Patients taking medications for CMD prechemotherapy were excluded from this part of the analysis. The secondary endpoint was the association between baseline variables and the office-based Framingham risk score (FRS) as assessed at the time of questionnaire completion ( 18 ). Changes in body fat distribution after chemotherapy were analyzed in 108 patients who underwent a CT scan within ±8 weeks of questionnaire completion. We analyzed 2 outcomes, time to new-onset CMD and postchemotherapy FRS, using the Cox proportional hazard regressions and linear regressions, respectively. Associations between new-onset CMD and baseline variables (prechemotherapy age, SBP, body mass index [BMI], logarithmic transformed VAT-to-SAT ratio, existing CMD) were examined using univariate Cox models. With a small event number, multivariable analyses were used to examine a base model with BMI group (ie, <25, 25-29, ≥30 kg/m 2 ), VAT-to-SAT ratio, and their interaction term as well as a model adding prechemotherapy age to account for its confounding effect. Complete data were used considering the rarity of missing data (0.4% and 2.0% patients missing prechemotherapy BMI and SBP, respectively). The proportional hazards assumption was satisfied in all Cox models based on time-weighted score tests ( 19 ). Univariate and multivariable linear regressions were used to examine associations between postchemotherapy FRS (logarithmic transformed) with baseline variables and the time interval from chemotherapy to Platinum Study questionnaire. Exponentiated beta coefficients from linear models (exp(ß)-estimate to account for the log-transformation of FRS) were used to report the degree of fold change in FRS for every 1 unit of change (or fold change) in a predictor variable ( 20 , 21 ). The multivariable model included variables and 2-way interaction terms selected by backward selection with  P  values less than .05. Comparison of variables between 2 timepoints was performed with paired  t  test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to assess correlations between continuous variables, and the χ 2  test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test variable differences between patients with or without follow-up CT. Statistical analyses were performed in software packages SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and R 4.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). All statistical tests were 2-sided, and a  P  less than .05 was considered statistically significant."

The median time from CT to chemotherapy initiation was 13 days (IQR = 6-21 days). On CT, the median VAT and SAT areas were 75 cm 2  (IQR = 37-140 cm 2 ) and 156 cm 2  (IQR = 100-228 cm 2 ), respectively, and the median VAT-to-SAT ratio was 0.49 (IQR = 0.31-0.75).

On prechemotherapy computed tomography. Of the 455 patients, 108 (23.7%) underwent a CT scan within ±8 weeks of questionnaire completion. Although the time between chemotherapy and questionnaire completion was shorter in these 108 patients vs those without an eligible follow-up CT (median 18 vs 36 months;  P  < .001), there were no other statistically significant differences in terms of clinical characteristics and fat distribution ( Supplementary Table 1 , available online). Despite the shorter median follow-up time, there was a statistically significant increase in BMI (median = +0.71 kg/m 2 , IQR = −0.40 to +2.30 kg/m 2 ,  P  < .001) from before chemotherapy and time of questionnaire completion postchemotherapy.

However, changes in BMI correlated positively with changes in the VAT-to-SAT ratio ( r  = 0.39,  P  < .001), indicating that weight gain preferentially occurred in the VAT compartment, whereas weight loss was commonly accompanied by favorable changes in body fat distribution ( Figure 4 ).

        "content": "To our knowledge, we demonstrate for the first time that preferential fat storage in the abdominal visceral compartment over the subcutaneous compartment (ie, “central adiposity”) at the time of chemotherapy initiation in TCSs is associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of subsequent CMD. In a subgroup analysis, we observed that the frequent weight gain observed after chemotherapy in TCSs tends to be accompanied by an unfavorable expansion of the visceral over the subcutaneous fat compartment. In contrast, individuals who lost weight after chemotherapy generally experienced an improvement in their body fat distribution. This study also shows for the first time, to our knowledge, that body fat distribution seems to be as important a cardiometabolic risk factor as overall body mass in TCSs, particularly in those who are obese. This implies that quantification of visceral and subcutaneous fat compartments before chemotherapy might help clinicians to more accurately identify patients in need for intensified intervention, for example, education, monitoring, and aggressive risk modulation. Importantly, because baseline CT scans are routinely performed before chemotherapy initiation, data on body fat distribution are readily accessible without additional radiation exposure or cost. Quantification of fat on CT can be performed expeditiously with built-in or open-source image-viewing software ( 22 ). The identification of visceral adiposity as a cardiometabolic risk factor in cisplatin-treated TCSs corroborates research in the general population ( 7 , 8 ) and in survivors of other cancer types ( 9–11 ). In a prospective analysis of more than 27 000 male and female participants in the INTERHEART study, Yusuf et al. ( 7 ) found that independent of overall body mass, central adiposity was a statistically significant risk factor for myocardial infarction. These associations were corroborated in a recent meta-analysis investigating the effects of body fat distribution on overall mortality in the general population ( 8 ) and emphasize the importance of body fat distribution in addition to overall body mass when assessing an individual’s cardiometabolic risk. In contrast to studies in the general population reporting a statistically significant association between central adiposity and cardiovascular disease across BMI ranges ( 7 , 23 ), our results indicate the effect of central adiposity was more pronounced in obese male TCSs. The younger age distribution of our cohort (median age = 31 years) relative to these other series (median age = 60-66 years) ( 7 , 23 ) may provide 1 explanation for these differences, given that the relative influence of fat depots on cardiometabolic risk may differ across age groups ( 24 , 25 ). Ali and colleagues ( 24 ), for example, reported that in children and adolescents, unlike in adults, subcutaneous adiposity was more strongly and positively associated with cardiometabolic risk than visceral fat. Similarly, Kjellberg et al. ( 25 ) observed a stronger association of subcutaneous fat with metabolic risk factors in children. In support of this hypothesis, we observed a statistically significant correlation of prechemotherapy age and BMI in our cohort of TCSs. However, we also observed that central adiposity holds greater prognostic importance in younger vs older TCSs. This again is in line with studies in the general population that show the associations of mortality with overall adiposity ( 26 , 27 ) and central adiposity ( 8 ) weaken with advancing age. Finally, chemotherapy may induce CMD through a different mechanism and pathophysiology than in the general population and could modulate interactions between age, BMI, and body fat distribution. Chemotherapy has also been proposed to accelerate the aging process, which could exert a greater effect on younger rather than older adults ( 28 ). Finally, older patients likely develop CMD in a shorter timeframe, and the relatively short follow-up period of this study might have led to an overestimation of their CMD risk compared with younger individuals. Many TCSs gain weight after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, as shown previously in both the Platinum Study ( 13 ) and the Norwegian cohort ( 29 ). The relative changes of VAT and SAT compartments in TCSs, however, are less well studied. One small investigation of 19 patients found a statistically significant increase in both visceral and subcutaneous fat compartments on magnetic resonance imaging 9 months after cisplatin-based chemotherapy ( 30 ), but longer-term studies were not conducted. Our observation that weight gain after chemotherapy tends to be accompanied by increased central adiposity in TCSs resembles previous observations of tape-measured waist-to-hip ratio changes in young men from the general population ( 31 ). Therefore, the preferential increase in visceral fat is probably only one of many factors in the pathogenesis of CMD in TCSs after cisplatin-based chemotherapy ( 3 , 32–34 ). To our knowledge, this is the only study to date to quantify CT-determined body fat distribution in TCSs, its changes after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and its associations with adverse health outcomes. A major strength of our investigation is that it was conducted within the Platinum Study, a rigorous multicenter investigation of TCSs with a high patient participation rate (93%), detailed medical record abstraction, physical examinations, and an assessment of adverse health outcomes and health behaviors using validated questionnaires ( 5 , 13 ). Another strength is that fat compartments were quantified on CT and that the applied method was previously validated in the Framingham Study ( 16 ); it provides a considerably more accurate representation of body fat distribution than clinical surrogates such as tape-measured waist and hip circumferences ( 35 ). The major limitation of our study is its retrospective design, with 455 (71%) of 639 MSKCC patients in the Platinum Study having an eligible prechemotherapy CT scan for the current investigation. It is unlikely, however, that selection bias was introduced, because the acquisition of pretreatment CTs is typically not related to the later development of CMD. Similarly, quantitative examination of changes in body fat distribution after chemotherapy necessitated limitation to those with an eligible follow-up CT. Because CT scan intervals are more frequent in the early period postchemotherapy, these patients had a shorter interval between chemotherapy and questionnaire completion. However, importantly, a systematic examination of other variables (eg, baseline age, BMI, fat distribution) ( Supplementary Table 1 , available online) found no statistically significant differences between the follow-up CT subgroup and the remainder of the cohort. In addition, despite this short follow-up interval, there was still a statistically significant increase in BMI following chemotherapy, a finding supported by clinical experience. Another limitation is that fat distribution was quantified on a single transverse CT slice as validated in a previous prospective study ( 16 ); although this surrogate might not perfectly represent body fat volumes, the 3-dimensional measurements of fat compartments on CT scans are considerably more labor intensive and would be difficult to integrate into a clinical workflow. Thus, the applied measurement method represents a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and practicability. Among patients with very little fat, the calculation of a VAT-to-SAT ratio might be susceptible to even small measurement variabilities, as reflected by the presence of outliers in normal or underweight patients. Although CT-derived quantifiers of body fat distribution must therefore be carefully interpreted in normal-weight or underweight individuals, our data also suggest that this is of low clinical significance given the low cardiometabolic risk of this group. Additionally, because the vast majority of our patients received 4 cycles of chemotherapy, we were not able to assess the potential confounding effect of the number of chemotherapy cycles on CMD risk ( 36 ). Other factors that potentially confound the reported associations of body fat distribution and CMD risk in TCSs but were also not included in the current analysis include testosterone levels and hypogonadism ( 37 , 38 ) as well as the effects of physical exercise ( 39 , 40 ). Finally, due to self-reported medication use as criterion for CMD and because CMD might be underdiagnosed in young individuals ( 41-43 ), the incidence of CMD might be underestimated in our patients. Central adiposity before cisplatin-based chemotherapy is a cardiometabolic risk factor for TCSs. The cardiometabolic health effects of an unfavorable body fat distribution with preferential fat accumulation in the visceral compartment are most pronounced in young or obese individuals. Importantly, these findings suggest that young or obese germ cell tumor patients with high VAT-to-SAT ratios before chemotherapy may benefit most from targeted CMD reduction interventions (blood pressure and lipid control, diet, and exercise). Future studies with long-term follow-up should evaluate the importance of dynamic changes in fat distribution at various time points postchemotherapy and test interventional strategies in this population."

    "abstract": "Objectives: To present our intermediate to long-term oncological and functional outcomes of robot-assisted retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RA-RPLND) in post-chemotherapy (PC) residual mass in testicular cancers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest single-centre experience of RA-RPLND for in such setting. Methods: Prospectively maintained database of carcinoma testis patients undergoing RA-RPLND from February 2012 to September 2021 was reviewed. Patient demographics, tumour stage and risk groups and chemotherapy details were recorded. Intraoperative details and post-operative complications were also noted. Pathological outcomes included were lymph node yield and histopathology report. Further, follow-up was done for recurrence and antegrade ejaculation status. Results: Total of 37 cases were done for PC residual masses. International germ cell cancer collaborative group good, intermediate and poor risk proportion was 18 (48.6%), 14 (37.8%) and 5 (13.5%), respectively. Bilateral full template dissection, unilateral modified template dissection and residual mass excision was performed in 59.5% (22/37), 35.1% (13/37) and 5.4% (2/37) patients, respectively. The median size of the excised residual mass was 3.45 cm interquartile range (IQR 2–6 cm), with the largest being 9 cm. The median lymph nodal yield was 19. The most common histology was necrosis ( n  = 24, 65%), followed by teratoma ( n  = 11, 30%) and viable malignancy ( n  = 2, 5%). Antegrade ejaculation was reported in 32 patients (86.4%). After a median follow-up of 41 (IQR 14–64) months, only one patient had a recurrence. Conclusions: RA-PC-RPLND is thus a safe, feasible and oncologically effective option for selected patients. With increasing experience, larger masses can also be dealt with efficiently.",

        "content": "Surgical resection of visible residual masses after chemotherapy for non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT) is mandated when serum levels of tumour markers are normal or normalising.[ 1 ] This is because a good number of patients harbour viable malignancy or teratoma in their retroperitoneum after chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced desmoplastic reaction, dissection around major vessels and need for multiorgan resection in addition to compromised pulmonary, renal and haematologic reserve make post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) a complex and challenging procedure. To reduce the morbidity related to open RPLND, laparoscopic and now robot-assisted RPLND (RA-RPLND) are increasingly being performed. The first published report of RA RPLND was in 2006.[ 2 ] Since then, many investigators have published their experiences. However, the follow-up in these studies is short, and data on PC RA-RPLND are sparse. We aim to present our intermediate-to-long-term oncological and functional outcomes of RA-RPLND in PC setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest single-centre experience of RA-RPLND for PC residual masses in testicular cancers. Growing experiences from studies including ours shall pave the way for the utilisation of robotic approach in early metastatic seminomas where their evidence for the use of RPLND is still expanding.[ 3 ]"

        "content": "A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of carcinoma testis patients undergoing RA-RPLND from February 2012 to September 2021 was done. Patients undergoing RA-RPLND performed by two Uro-onco-surgeons (SKR, AS) for PC residual masses were analysed. Baseline patient details, tumour characteristics and chemotherapy details were recorded. Response evaluation after chemotherapy was done using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan for NSGCT and positron emission tomography CT for seminoma. Intraoperative details such as operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), patient position, dissection template and additional procedures performed were noted. Patient was placed in a modified lithotomy position with arms by the side. Pressure points were padded, and shoulder supports were applied. The table was made steep Trendelenburg with a 10°–15° right tilt to make small bowel fall out of the field. 8 mm camera port was placed in between the umbilicus and symphysis pubis. Other working robotic ports were made, two in the right lower quadrant and one in the left lower quadrant. Two assistant ports (one 5 mm, another 12 mm) were created in the left lower quadrant, as shown in  Figure 1 . (a) Port positions for RA-RPLND in supine position, (b) Docking from head end for da Vinci Si and X, (c) Lateral docking from left side for Xi system. RA-RPLND: Robot-assisted retroperitoneal lymph node dissection The robotic surgical technique used has been previously described.[ 4 ] The surgery was performed using da Vinci Si HD , X and Xi surgical system. The Si HD  platform was used in the initial cases, but now we are using the later ones. The peritoneal flap of the small bowel mesentery and descending colon can be sutured to the anterior abdominal wall for retraction. In addition, a ‘reverse’ Pansadora stitch for the sigmoid colon may aid exposure [ Figure 2 ]. In the Xi system, the robot was undocked at the completion of the retroperitoneal part and redocked after rotation of boom for the pelvic part and remnant cord excision. Abdominal Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in all patients. (a) Peritoneal retraction stitch, (b) Reverse Pansadora stitch being taken, (c) Retracted colon and visible para-aortic mass after the stitch, (d) Preserved sympathetic nerves, (e) Completed bilateral template dissection Post-operatively, early ambulation was encouraged, and thromboprophylaxis was given to all patients. The drain was removed by days 3–4 when output was serous and <300 ml/day. The patient was discharged with the drain if the output was chylous and/or more than 300 ml/day. A step-up approach was followed for the management of chylous ascites. Initially, dietary modifications in the form of fat-free diet and medium chain triglyceride-based feeding are initiated. Injection of octreotide 100 mcg subcutaneous thrice daily was added if dietary modifications failed to decrease the output. In addition, the patient may be kept nil per oral and parenteral nutrition initiated if the above measures fail. In refractory cases, interventions such as surgical re-exploration or intralymphatic lipoidal injection are contemplated. Pathological outcomes included were lymph node yield and histology of the specimen. Further, follow-up was done for recurrence and antegrade ejaculation status. The assessment of ejaculation was based on patient interview during follow-up with patient answering it either as present, absent or present with low volume."

        "content": "Between February 2012 and September 2021, 40 RA-RPLND were performed, of which 37 were done for PC residual masses, and the remaining three were primary RPLND. The results described subsequently pertain to the PC-RA-RPLND cohort. The median age of the cohort was 27 years interquartile range (IQR 23–34.5). Median body mass index at surgery was 23.69 kg/m 2  (IQR 20.62–26.15). The most common histology of the testicular primary was NSGCT ( n  = 33, 89.2%) with seminoma in one (2.7%) and burnt-out primary in 4 (10.8%) patients. Bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) was the most commonly received induction chemotherapeutic regime (35/37). Three of the 37 patients received additional second-line chemotherapy before surgery [ Table 1 ]. Tumour characteristics and operative details RA-RPLND: Robot-assisted retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, P-RA-RPLND: Primary RA-RPLND, PC-RA-RPLND: Post-chemotherapy RA-RPLND, NSGCT: Non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, BEP: Bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin, TIP: Paclitaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin, VeIP: Vinblastine, ifosfamide, cisplatin, VIP: Etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin, VAC: Vincristine, dactinomycin and cyclophosphamide The procedure was performed in lateral position and supine position in 43% (16/37) and 57% (21/37) patients, respectively. Bilateral full template dissection was performed in 59.5% (22/37) of patients with unilaterally modified template dissection and residual mass excision was performed in 35.1% (13/37) and 5.4% (2/37) patients, respectively. Nerve preservation by virtue of unilateral template and/or dedicated nerve sparing dissection was achieved in 33 (89%) patients. The median console time and EBL were 180 (IQR 150–300) min and 150 ml, respectively. The median size of the excised residual mass was 3.45 cm (IQR 2–6 cm), with the largest mass successfully excised being 9 cm. The median lymph nodal yield was 19 with the most common histology in the excised nodes being necrosis ( n  = 24, 65%), followed by teratoma ( n  = 11, 30%) and viable malignancy ( n  = 2, 5%) [ Table 2 ]. Comparison with contemporary series *Continuous variables are presented as median (IQR) and categorical variable as  n  (%) except series of Nason who reported range,  $ Two cases were desperation RPLND,  # Console time.

High inguinal orchiectomy at the time of RPLND was performed in three patients. Eight patients (21.6%) underwent procedures in addition to RPLND either simultaneously or staged for complete oncologic clearance. The details of these procedures are given in  Table 3 . Thoracic mass excision (open/video assisted) was the most common additional procedure performed in six patients (75%). Viable malignancy was detected in one such patient who had necrosis on the RPLND biopsy. Another patient who had mature teratoma on the RPLND specimen also had mature teratoma on bilateral lung mass excision. One patient underwent supraclavicular lymph node dissection in addition to RPLND and bilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery. Interestingly, immature teratoma was detected in the neck nodes despite necrosis being detected in the abdomen + chest specimens. Additional resection, its pathology and retroperitoneal pathology *Patient underwent open conversion for IVC injury. VATS: Video-assisted thoracic surgery, SCLN: Supra clavicular lymph node, IVC: Inferior vena cava Major intraoperative complications encountered included aortic ( n  = 1) and inferior vena cava (IVC) injury ( n  = 1). The aortic injury was successfully managed robotically; however, the IVC injury necessitated open conversion. Overall, 4 (10.8%) patients required conversion to open approach. Indications for conversion being: dense desmoplasia with the inability to proceed ( n  = 3) and dense desmoplasia, leading to intraoperative IVC injury ( n  = 1) [ Table 4 ]. Post-operative complications Post-operatively, Chylous drain output was seen in 9 (24.3%) patients which was managed conservatively in four patients, required intralymphatic lipoidal injection in two patients and open surgical ligation in three patients. Paralytic ileus was seen in four patients (10.8%) and was managed conservatively in all. Blood transfusions were required in three patients. None of our patients experienced any pulmonary complications in the post-operative period. At a median follow-up of 41 (IQR 14-64) months, recurrence was seen in only one patient [ Table 5 ]. This patient had International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) intermediate-risk disease and both pre and PC stage IIC. Bilateral standard template dissection was done, and 30 lymph nodes were identified. Pathology was suggestive of necrosis. Unfortunately, patient reported at 4 months with a rise in tumour markers. Imaging revealed recurrences in the liver, pelvis and retroperitoneum. The patient was started on salvage chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfaomide and cisplatin (TIP) regimen. However, the patient progressed and deteriorated after one cycle and succumbed. Antegrade ejaculation was reported in 32 patients (86.4%).

        "section_name": "DISCUSSION",
        "content": "We report possibly the largest single-centre experience of RA-PC-RPLND performed by two highly experienced surgeons from a tertiary care centre dealing with high volumes of testicular cancer. This report of consecutive cases reiterates the feasibility and safety and, more importantly, highlights the long-term oncological efficacy of the procedure in this select cohort of patients. RA-RPLND is a complex and challenging undertaking more so in the PC setting where studies have shown longer operative times, higher EBL with a greater proportion of patients requiring adjunctive procedures/open conversion and higher rates of perioperative complications as compared to primary RPLND.[ 5 , 6 ] The use of the robotic approach for RPLND is aimed at reducing perioperative morbidity and enhancing recovery after surgery. Considerable expertise from open RPLND and the inherent advantages of the robotic platform (tremor filtration, 3D vision, magnification and 7° of motion freedom) enabled our smooth transition into minimally invasive RPLND. Our approach gradually evolved from the lateral approach to the supine approach over a period of time which was greatly aided by the upgradation of the da Vinci Si to the latest Xi version. Inherent patient hesitation to undergo primary RPLND and the increasing role of chemotherapy in the management of testicular tumours are reflected in the very low numbers of primary RPLND performed at our institution. Thus, we started initially with smaller PC residual masses, and as our experience grew, we became adept at managing larger masses such that more than one-third of the excised masses measure 5 cm or more in size, with the largest size successfully removed robotically being 9 cm. Patient selection is critical for PC-RA-RPLND. Authors have suggested avoiding the procedure in patients with ≥5 cm lesions and/or intermediate/poor risk IGCGCG groups as chances of vascular intervention in such patients is high.[ 7 ] We believe that volume of the retroperitoneal disease is not the only factor that should be considered while selecting a patient for RA-PC-RPLND. Chemotherapy-induced intense perinodal fibrosis and adhesions can even make resection of smaller masses a daunting task. Unfortunately, pre-operative imaging at present is not accurate enough to predict such reactions and the magnitude of desmoplasia needs to be assessed intraoperatively. Patients with large-volume disease, circumferential major vessel involvement and renal vessel encasement should seldom be approached robotically. There is always a risk of major vascular injury owing to the lack of tactile feedback with plastered planes PC. Such injuries may be managed robotically with no further consequence (as the aortic injury in our study) or may require open conversion (as was required for the IVC injury). The rate of open conversion in our series was 10.8%, with dense desmoplastic reaction with failure to progress safely being the most common reason. These patients belonged to IGCCCG intermediate ( n  = 2) and poor ( n  = 2) risk categories. The reported rates in the literature vary from 10% to 25%,[ 5 - 7 ] with commonly reported factors leading to conversion being poor retroperitoneal exposure, renal vascular injury necessitating repair/nephrectomy and/or ventilatory issues secondary to pneumoperitoneum. Retroperitoneal exposure can be optimised by routine hitching of the peritoneal curtain to the anterior abdominal wall, which also prevents the small bowel loops from coming into the field. An additional 10°–15° right tilt in the supine Trendelenburg position also helps. A ‘reverse’ Pansadora stitch can help retract the sigmoid from the operative field. Chylous ascites are one of the most common complications after RA-RPLND for testis cancer and have been reported to be in the range of 3%–11% in different RA-PC-RPLND series.[ 5 - 8 ] The incidence of Chylous leak in our patients was 24.3%. It may be noteworthy that the increased incidence may be attributed to a few factors. We routinely place intraabdominal drains in all our patients undergoing RPLND, which is not what is practised universally at other centres where a pigtail/drain is inserted if complications due to chylous ascites/lymphocoeles arise. Furthermore, low-fat dietary modifications are not instituted as a dictum in all our patients postoperatively. We do acknowledge the fact that 12% of our patients required an intervention for the management of significant chylous output. All these cases were seen in the 1 st  2 years of programme initiation and could be attributed to scarce clipping of major lymphatics, especially around the left renal vein and para-aortic region. We learned from our mistakes and made appropriate amends to our technique and since then have not experienced any case of chylous leak requiring an intervention for management. Our patients are usually referrals from distant parts of the country and thus are discharged once their drains are removed, normal diet is tolerated well and no intravenous fluid supplementation is required. These factors may account for a slightly longer length of hospital stay seen in our study. Recurrences after open PC-RPLND have been reported to the tune of 11%–22.7%,[ 9 , 10 ] depending on the template of dissection and IGCCCG risk stratification. Direct comparison of PC-RA-RPLND oncological outcomes with the open cohort is not wise as the former is offered in the highly selected group of patients. Contemporary series of RA-PC-RPLND have reported recurrence rates of approximately 10%–11%.[ 6 , 7 ] We report a much lesser recurrence rate of 2.7%. Approximately two-third of our patients had necrosis in their RPLND specimen biopsy as compared to approximately one-third in the other series. Furthermore, the proportion of viable malignancy at RPLND in our series was only 5% as compared to 17% and 31% reported by Li  et al . and Ohlmann  et al. , respectively. Calaway  et al . report from a high-volume referral centre described unique aberrant recurrences in patients undergoing RA-RPLND (primary/PC) elsewhere, implicating that the robotic approach may have been responsible for such patterns of recurrence.[ 11 ] We did not experience any unusual pattern of recurrences in our study. Most recurrences reported in these patients usually occur within 2 years of surgery,[ 12 ] and thus, our median follow-up of 41 months is a sufficient period to comment on at least early relapses following this procedure. Reports of robotic RPLND by Stepanian  et al. ,[ 13 ] Pearce  et al .[ 14 ] and Rocco  et al .[ 15 ] on 20, 47 and 58 procedures which included both primary and PC patients and median follow of 49, 16 and 47 months, respectively, have also not reported any in-field recurrences or unusual out-of-field recurrences.[ 9 ] Antegrade ejaculation was seen in 86.4% of our patients. Four of these patients subjectively reported decreased ejaculate volume. Nerve preservation at RPLND requires sound knowledge of the retroperitoneal neuroanatomy.[ 16 ] Despite the desmoplastic reaction seen in PC patients, one can still perform nerve preservation. Ejaculation status post-R RPLND for testis cancer is reported in very few studies, with rates of retrograde ejaculation ranging from 10% to 20%.[ 13 , 17 , 18 ] Growing experiences from studies including ours shall pave the way for utilisation of robotic approach in early metastatic seminomas where their evidence for the use of RPLND is still expanding."

        "content": "No study is without limitations. Although this is the largest experience of PC-RA-RPLND yet, the numbers are still low. Direct head-to-head comparisons of open and robotic approaches for similar PC-RPLND patients are needed to definitively establish the role of RA-PC-RPLND. A longer follow-up may reveal information regarding late relapses in patients undergoing this procedure. RA-PC-RPLND is thus a safe, feasible and oncologically effective option for selected patients with a definitive learning curve. With increasing experience, larger masses can be dealt with efficiently with this approach. However, such cases are better suited to high-volume centres with multispeciality assistance available if required. Strict adherence to oncologic principles is a must to deliver the best outcomes to these patients. The research was approved by Institutional Review Board (No. RGCIRC/IRB/12/2022). Nil.

    "title": "Immunosenescence profile and expression of the aging biomarker ( p16 INK4a )  in testicular cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy",
    "abstract": "Background Cytotoxic chemotherapy can cure advanced germ cell tumors. Nevertheless, cancer treatment may induce cellular senescence and accelerate molecular aging. The aging process implies an increase of cells expressing  p16 INK4a  and changes in lymphocyte subpopulations. Our aim was to study the potential induction of premature immunosenescence in testicular cancer survivors (TCS) exposed to chemotherapy. Methods Case-control exploratory study of TCS treated with chemotherapy (≥3 BEP cycles, disease-free ≥3 months) compared with age matched healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry. CDKN2A /p16 INK4a  expression in T cells was measured using qPCR. The percentage of lymphocyte subpopulations and the CDKN2A/ p16 INK4a  expression in TCS were compared with the control group using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results We included 16 cases and 16 controls. The median age was 27 years (minimum 24, maximum 54) and the median time on surveillance was 26.5 months (minimum 3, maximum192). TCS had a lower percentage of total T cells and CD4+ T cells in total lymphocytes. Among the CD4+ T lymphocytes, TCS had less naïve CD4+ and increased memory CD4+ cells. Within the CD8+ T lymphocytes, TCS exhibited a decrease in the percentage of naïve cells and an increase in CD8 + CD45RA + CD57+ cells. TCS also exhibited decreased memory CD19+ B cells compared to the controls. The relative expression of CDKN2A /p16 INK4a  in T cells was increased in TCS (mean 1.54; 95% CI of the mean: 1.074–2.005;  p  = 0.048). Conclusion In this exploratory study, TCS showed increased expression of CDKN2A /p16 INK4a  and a lymphocyte phenotype that has been associated with immunosenescence. Further studies are warranted to define the clinical implications of these alterations in TCS.",

        "content": "Germ Cell Testicular Cancer (TC) mainly affects young males between 15 and 35 years old [ 1 ]. It is estimated that there were 71,105 new cases and 9507 deaths worldwide in 2018 [ 2 ]. It is the most curable solid neoplasm, and even if it presents in advanced stages, it can still be cured with current chemotherapy regimens [ 3 ]. According to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification (IGCCC), more than 90% of patients with good risk disease will be cured, the intermediate-risk group has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 80%, and patients with the poor-risk disease have a 5-year survival rate of nearly 50% [ 4 ]. However, testicular cancer survivors (TCS) struggle with the long-term toxicity of oncologic treatment. Side effects include increased incidence of secondary malignancies, hypogonadism, pulmonary toxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, augmented mortality from circulatory diseases, and an increased risk of infections [ 5 ,  6 ]. TCS have a higher risk of dying from non-cancerous causes, including infections, digestive diseases, respiratory and circulatory diseases, than the general population [ 6 ]. The aging process within the immune system is called immunosenescence. The clinical manifestations associated with immunosenescence in the elderly include a decreased ability to control infections, poor response to vaccination, and an increment in the risk of developing cancer [ 7 ]. Several immunological alterations have been described with aging, including changes in T and B lymphocytes subpopulations and natural killer (NK) cells [ 7 ]. Of note, there is a decrease in naïve CD4+/CD8+ ratio and an increase in memory T cells relative to naïve [ 7 ]. CD4+ CD28- T cells, a unique type of proinflammatory T cells that lack expression of the costimulatory CD28 receptor, accumulate in healthy individuals older than 65 years old, whereas healthy young people have only a few CD4 + CD28- T cells [ 8 ]. The elderly population also experiences an increase in CD57+ terminally differentiated senescent cells, which have a reduced proliferative capacity and altered functional properties [ 9 ]. The B lymphocyte compartment also shows a decrease in naïve B cells with a reciprocal increase in memory B cells [ 10 ]. Aging is also characterized by a decrease in circulating antibody levels [ 10 ]. At the functional level, NK cells exhibit decreased cytotoxicity, and NK T cells reduced migratory capacity [ 11 ]. p16 INK4a , a cell-cycle regulating protein and an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, plays an important role in cellular aging and premature senescence and has been recognized as an aging biomarker [ 12 ].  p16 INK4a  expression in peripheral blood T cells has been described to sharply increase with chronological age and contributes to an age-induced functional decline of certain self-renewing compartments [ 13 ]. Cytotoxic chemotherapy can induce cellular senescence and accelerate molecular aging in cancer cells [ 14 ]. However, this effect in non-tumoral cells has not been fully addressed. Changes in lymphocyte phenotype and an increased expression of  p16 INK4a  in CD3+ lymphocytes have been reported in breast cancer survivors after adjuvant chemotherapy [ 15 ]. To date, this phenomenon has not been studied in TCS population; a group of patients that warrants special attention given the fact that they develop neoplastic disease and receive oncologic treatments at a very young age, and premature immunosenescence may impose many consequences during their lifespan. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on the peripheral lymphocyte population and expression of CDKN2A / p16INK4a, in order to assess premature immunosenescence."

        "content": "A case-control exploratory study of testicular cancer survivors (TCS) treated with chemotherapy matched by age and gender with healthy controls. Cases were defined as TCS, 18 years old or older, who were in surveillance and no evidence of disease (NED) ≥ 3 months (negative tumor markers and computed tomography (CT) image with no evidence of disease after the last oncologic treatment), and who had received at least 3 BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin) cycles. Patients treated with high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant were excluded. Controls were healthy males, with no previous history of cancer, matched by age (+/− 12 months) in a 1:1 ratio. Before the inclusion in the study and in order to be considered “healthy”, all participants were evaluated clinically by an Internal Medicine specialist (MTB) and screened for type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. This study was approved by the Institutional Biomedical Research Board of the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (REF. 1785). All subjects were informed about the objectives of the study and gave their written consent to participate. A sample of venous blood (40 mL) was obtained from each subject. PBMC were isolated by gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway). Researchers were blinded to the origin of the sample cases vs controls. CD3-mAb-coated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) were used to purify CD3+ cells by positive selection following the manufacturer’s instructions. Purity was assessed by flow cytometry with an anti-human CD3-FITC monoclonal antibody. This procedure normally yielded CD3+ T-cell preparations with purity > 95%. Total RNA from CD3+ lymphocytes was obtained using Trizol (Life Technology, New York, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA by using random hexamers as primers and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT) following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The expression of CDKN2A /p16 INK4a  was measured using the qPCR Taqman assay (TaqMan Universal Master Mix II, with UNG, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. TaqMan probes were used for CDKN2A /p16 INK4a  (P16-FAM HS_00924091), Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and 18S (18S-VIC HS_99999901) (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, USA). The samples were performed in duplicate in the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) equipment Corbett Research model RG-6000 (Sydney, Australia) using the program Roto-gene 6000 version 1.7. The relative expression in cases vs controls of CDKN2A /p16 INK4a  was analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCt method comparing each case with a matched control. EDTA-treated blood samples were analyzed by 8-color flow-cytometry (Becton Dickinson Canto II Cytometer) using fluorescence-labelled antibodies from Biolegend Inc. (San Diego, USA). Briefly, 250 μL of blood was incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for 20 min at room temperature prior to lysis (RBC Lysis Buffer, Biolegend Inc., San Diego, USA) and fixed with 3% formaldehyde/PBS. Leukocytes populations were defined by the following marker combinations: B cells CD3- CD19+, T cells CD3+, CD4 T cells CD3 + CD4+, CD8 T cells CD3 + CD8+, CD4 naïve CD4 + CD45RA + CD197+, CD4 central memory (TCM) CD4 + CD45RO + CD197+, CD4 effector memory (TEM) CD4 + CD45RO + CD197-, CD8 naïve CD3 + CD8 + CD45RA + CD197+, CD8 TCM CD3 + CD8 + CD45RO + CD197+, CD8 TEM CD3 + CD8 + CD45RO + CD2197-, NKT cells CD4 + CD56 + CD16high, NK cells CD4-CD56+, naïve B cells CD19 + CD20 + CD27-, Memory B cells CD19 + CD20 + CD27+, Plasmablasts CD19 + CD20-CD27 + CD38high, CD4 Treg cells CD4 + CD127lowCD25+, and CD8 Treg cells CD8 + CD28-. OneFlow™Setup Beads (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) were used to adjust instrument settings, set fluorescence compensation, and check instrument sensitivity. ‘Fluorescence minus one’ controls were used to determine positive and negative staining boundaries for each fluorochrome. Five hundred thousand events were recorded for each sample and analyzed with the FlowJo® software v.10. (FlowJo, LLC., Ashland, OR). For initial gating, singlets were identified using the FSC-Height (FSC-H) by FSC-Area (FSC-A) scatter plot. Then the lymphocyte population was gated in a plot SSC-A versus FSC-A. From there, subsequent gating was designed to identify major populations. Cases and controls were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, a  p- value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results are expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR) unless otherwise indicated. For analysis of significance of the relative expression of CDKN2A / p16INK4a in cases vs controls, Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. SPSS® version 21.0 and GraphPad prism v.7.05 were used for the analysis."

        "content": "The results of this exploratory study showed that testicular cancer survivors (TCS) previously treated with chemotherapy have an immunological phenotype associated with immunosenescence and increased expression of the aging biomarker  p16 INK4a  in CD3+ lymphocytes. These findings suggest that TCS exposed to chemotherapy might experience premature aging of the immune cells. Immunological alterations found in TCS after exposure to chemotherapy, revealed a reduced proportion of naïve T cells and a concomitant increment of memory T cells compared to age-matched controls. These changes are similar to those that usually occur in humans as they age and correlate with an immune risk phenotype in the elderly [ 10 ]. As humans age, there is an increase in CD57+ terminally differentiated “senescent” cells, which have a reduced proliferative capacity and altered functional properties. TCS, in our study, exhibited an increased percentage in the CD8+ CD45RA+ CD57+ cells (41.6% (22.2–55.6) vs 24.7% (10.1–32.2)  p  = 0.015) compared to controls. TCS exhibited a trend towards an increment in CD28- cells (8.3% vs 1.5%), a group of pro-inflammatory cells that increase gradually with age and may account for up to 50% in the geriatric population. The percentage of CD28-cells in the control group was 1.5% which is within the expected values for the young adults (0.1–2.5%) [ 8 ]. In the B lymphocyte subpopulation, there were no significant differences between cases and controls in naïve cells. Interestingly, we documented a lower percentage of memory CD19+ cells in TCS. This phenomenon was not expected as part of the immunosenescence phenotype, besides it could be linked to a reciprocal change in response to primary alterations observed in T cells. Similar changes have been described in patients infected with HIV [ 16 ], who present diminished CD4+ counts during the course of the active disease, and perhaps this affects the activation of naïve B cells by cognate T cells, with consequent alteration in the induction and survival of memory B cells [ 17 ]. p16 INK4a  is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and an aging biomarker, which renders the senescence growth arrest irreversible. This kinase is encoded by the CDKN2A gene, and it has been shown to be increased in women with breast cancer exposed to chemotherapy. Expression in peripheral blood CD3+ T lymphocytes (PBTLs), has been recognized as a diagnostic marker of senescence in vivo given its very large dynamic range (approximately 16-fold change over a human lifespan), ease and low cost of measure, and strong correlation with chronological age [ 13 ,  15 ,  18 – 20 ]. Our study provides insight on the differences of the lymphocyte phenotype and CDKN2A /p16 INK4a  expression in a healthy cohort and our TCS population, showing increased expression in the later population. Other factors, such as diabetes and hypogonadism could alter  p16 INK4a  expression. Type 2 diabetes could potentially bias the results, however, all the participants were tested for fasting glucose, and none of them had diabetes. Additionally, hypogonadism can occur as a side effect in TCS after treatment and could explain an increase of this aging biomarker. Our patients are assessed once a year, and none of the included individuals had criteria for the diagnosis of hypogonadism, and testosterone levels were within normal limits. This was a cross-sectional study, and we do not know if these alterations remain stable over time. However, TCS were analyzed at different time points after treatment, and there is no evidence of a transitory induction of  p16 INK4a .  At inclusion in the study, our TCS had already experienced cancer and oncologic treatment. The causal nature of the effect of chemotherapy versus cancer itself remains to be defined. There were no differences in CDKN2A / p16 INK4a  expression between patients that received 3 ( n  = 8) or 4 cycles (n = 8) of BEP ( p  = 0.37) or patients that received one ( n  = 12) or two chemotherapy regimens ( n  = 4) ( p  = 0.93). Future evaluations are planned to be done in a longitudinal study that allows a patient’s evaluation at diagnosis, during and after oncologic treatments. Additionally, this will also allow to discern whether a more intensive chemotherapy regimen (> 3 cycles of BEP, exposure to second-line chemotherapy or high dose chemotherapy) has a greater impact on  p16 INK4a  expression. The immunosenescent phenotype is believed to contribute to the development of an immune risk profile in the elderly, associated with an increased rate of infections and a diminished effect of vaccines, and increased cancer susceptibility. The clinical implications of these senescent changes in TCS warrant further investigation. Our findings have added more evidence to potential chemotherapy consequences in the TCS population. We believe this observation reinforces the importance of considering surveillance over chemotherapy or radiation therapy in early stages of the disease. It is possible that premature aging may occur in other organs and tissue compartments of TCS and this is a matter of further study."

    "abstract": "Purpose In this review, we summarize and discuss contemporary treatment standards and possible selection criteria for decision making after failure of adjuvant or first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy for primarily localized or metastatic germ cell tumors. Methods This work is based on a systematic literature search conducted for the elaboration of the first German clinical practice guideline to identify prospective clinical trials and retrospective comparative studies published between Jan 2010 and Feb 2021. Study end points of interest were progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), relapse rate (RR), and/or safety. Results Relapses of clinical stage I (CS I) patients irrespective of prior adjuvant treatment after orchiectomy are treated stage adapted in accordance for primary metastatic patients. Surgical approaches for sole retroperitoneal relapses are investigated in ongoing clinical trials. The appropriate salvage chemotherapy for metastatic patients progressing or relapsing after first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy is still a matter of controversy. Conventional cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the international guideline-endorsed standard of care, but based on retrospective data high-dose chemotherapy and subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation may offer a 10–15% survival benefit for all patients. Secondary complete surgical resection of all visible residual masses irrespective of size is paramount for treatment success. Conclusions Patients relapsing after definite treatment of locoregional disease are to be treated by stage-adapted first-line standard therapy for metastatic disease. Patients with primary advanced/metastatic disease failing one line of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy should be referred to GCT expert centers. Dose intensity is a matter of ongoing debate, but sequential high-dose chemotherapy seems to improve patients’ survival.",

        "content": "Cancer-specific survival of clinical stage I (CS I) germ cell tumor (GCT) patients is excellent irrespective of the application of adjuvant treatment following orchiectomy and active surveillance for all patients is considered safe while omitting possible side effects of adjuvant treatments [ 1 ,  2 ]. Since the introduction of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, germ cell tumors have become an example of a curable solid malignancy even in advanced metastatic disease. In metastatic non-seminomas prognosis in all three groups according to the IGCCCG classification as well as the good and intermediate prognosis in seminoma improved over time according to two recent large retrospective analyses [ 3 ,  4 ]. In patients with relapses following primary treatment, two scenarios demand attention: (i) patients with recurrent disease during active surveillance for CS I disease or after adjuvant chemotherapy in case of high-risk parameters and (ii) patients with relapse after first-line cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Although chemotherapy in case of recurrent disease from CS I disease is the standard choice in non-seminomas, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) can be effectively applied in a carefully selected subset of patients. Ongoing studies also assess the option of surgery in seminomas with retroperitoneal relapse (CS II). Treatment of relapses after cisplatin-based chemotherapy and potential residual mass resection is more challenging. Patients are treated either with conventional salvage cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens or by high-dose chemotherapy."

        "content": "Guideline-endorsed treatment of choice for patients with clinical stage I seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell cancer is active surveillance, which provides excellent cure rates while avoiding side effects of available adjuvant treatment. For non-seminomatous GCT patients, the risk of relapse from occult metastases is about 30% irrespective of risk factors, and with respect to the absence or presence of lymphovascular invasion 15–20% or 50%, respectively [ 5 – 9 ]. In seminomas the risk of relapse for CS I patients is about 15–25% regardless of risk factors [ 10 ,  11 ] and ranges from 13 to 14% for patients without risk factors and 23–24% for a primary tumor size ≥ 4 cm or rete testis invasion [ 6 ,  11 ]. Relapses after CS I most frequently occur in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and less frequently more widespread metastases occur during the first 2 and 3 years of non-seminoma and seminoma follow-up. Relapsing patients are reclassified according to the UICC stage categories and treated according to current guideline recommendations for primary metastatic disease after IGCCCG classification. For CS IIA/B at relapse these include surgery or chemotherapy for non-seminomas and radiotherapy or chemotherapy or a combination of both for seminomas [ 12 – 15 ]. Since reducing the treatment burden while maintaining treatment success with respect to treatment-related long-term sequelae is of utmost importance in young GCT patients, surgical approaches sparing chemotherapy and radiotherapy in CS IIA/B patients are of particular interest. In CS I and CS II non-seminomatous GCTs retroperitoneal lymph node dissection can be seen as a staging and curative approach [ 16 ]. Consequently, chemotherapy is not automatically the treatment of choice. In late relapses usually defined after a period of more than two years without tumor marker elevation or patients with a high percentage of teratomatous components in the primary have a significant increased risk of harboring pure teratoma in retroperitoneal manifestations [ 17 ,  18 ] with surgery being the standard of care. Further, to avoid side effects from systemic chemotherapy Hamilton et al. [ 19 ] described the results of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, which is generally recommended for tumor marker-negative late recurrences after chemotherapy. In this large retrospective analysis of prospectively collected patients this treatment approach was investigated in patients with recurrent disease on active surveillance. Of 580 patients with CS I non-seminomatous GCTs, 162 men relapsed during active surveillance. In retroperitoneal recurrences less than 3 cm in short axis diameter, tumor markers S0 and S1 with low doubling time (which is not described in detail), full bilateral nerve sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) was performed. In total, 45 patients (72.6%) of the patients were cured by RPLND alone. On multivariate analysis, only tumor marker elevation was an independent risk factor for subsequent additional treatment (HR6.05; 95%CI1.59–23.09;  p  < 0.0084). Only 17.8% of the patients with negative markers needed further treatment. Even in patients with elevated markers prior to surgery no additional treatment was necessary in half of the patients. There were no cancer-related deaths in the group, although the authors critically remark that those patients had a more favorable disease at relapse. The authors highlighted a significantly lower number of cumulative chemotherapy cycles with a primary RPLND at relapse, which was almost equal to patients who had received one cycle of adjuvant BEP [ 19 ]. Data on retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with seminoma concentrate on low volume disease in newly diagnosed disease. Due to the historic and retrospective character, trials are heterogeneous and difficult to interpret [ 20 – 22 ]. The relapse rates ranged from 0 to 67% depending on clinical stage. Patients who had CS I and IIA did not suffer in-field recurrences following surgical primary treatment, out-field relapses occurred in 7% [ 22 ]. Meanwhile, there are two prospective trials ongoing, SEMS-Trial, and PRIMETEST (NCT01537548;  NCT02797626 ) in patients with CS IIA-C seminoma. In the PRIMETEST study, not only primary disease cases but also relapses under active surveillance or following adjuvant chemotherapy were included. The rationale for both trials is to reduce the long-term morbidity of radiotherapy, the guideline-endorsed standard in CS IIA, or chemotherapy, the standard of care in clinical stage IIB, through salvage surgery. As no intensified chemotherapy had been applied earlier, there are no desmoplastic reactions; thus, the surgical risks and challenges are comparable to primary RPLND in non-seminomatous GCTs. In both trials, progression-free survival (at 2 or 3 years) is the primary endpoint. As secondary endpoints, quality of life and surgical complication rates are being assessed to obtain data on RPLND safety in low volume primary and recurrent seminoma with retroperitoneal spread only. An interim analysis of the German PRIMETEST trial was presented at the ASCO GU Meeting 2019 with promising results [ 23 ]. At this time, 14 patients had been included and after a median follow-up of 12.5 [ 3 – 25 ] months 4 relapses occurred. 12 of the 14 patients had either retroperitoneal progression on active surveillance ( n  = 10) or after adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin. Contrarily to historic data, predominantly patients with clinical stage IIA disease relapsed after RPLND. The SEMS trial highlighted a 2-year progression-free survival of 82% in 55 patients [ 24 ]. Compared to PRIMETEST only primary surgery was allowed, excluding relapses after adjuvant chemotherapy. The final results of the aforementioned two prospective clinical trials are expected and will probably strengthen the impact of RPLND in CS II seminomas at primary diagnosis and relapse from CS I disease. RPLND is a challenging surgery, in the primary setting as well as after chemotherapy in metastasized disease and even more in the salvage and desperation surgery situation. As clinical outcomes and negative side effects are significantly improved if performed by experienced surgeons, such kind of treatment should be performed in expert centers [ 19 ,  20 ,  25 ,  26 ]. Patients relapsing with advanced metastatic disease (≥ IIC) are classified according to the IGCCCG risk classification and treated according to primary metastatic GCTs by sequential cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy [ 12 – 15 ,  27 ]. Interestingly, in a small retrospective study by Fischer et al., patients relapsing after one to two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) seemed to more frequently suffer late relapses than patients on active surveillance and to have inferior outcomes after systemic salvage treatment compared to historical cohorts of patients undergoing first-line combination chemotherapy for de novo metastatic disease [ 28 ]. Despite the fact that 84% of the analyzed patients had a good prognosis according to the IGCCCG classification at first relapse after adjuvant BEP, a second relapse rate of 29% is high. This was discussed to be likely associated with a selection for patients with chemoresistant disease and a delayed onset relapse, which are both known risk factors for unfavorable outcomes. Thus, adjuvant pre-treatment for CS I non-seminomatous disease may negatively impact the prognosis and success of systemic salvage treatment, but this so far does not imply different, i.e. more intensive, salvage treatment approaches. It should only be respected for patient consultation and planning of post-chemo follow-up. The choice of first salvage treatment after 3–4 cycles of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, usually bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) or etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP), is still a matter of controversial discussion. Salvage strategies comprise either conventional dose or high-dose chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of residual post-chemotherapy masses [ 12 ,  14 ,  15 ]. In a large retrospective analysis, the International Prognostic Factor Study Group (IPFSG) established a risk score identifying five distinct risk groups based on seven clinical characteristics (Table  1 ). There was a significant difference in 2-year PFS rate and 3-year OS rate between the five risk groups. Patients with a very low risk profile had a favorable 2-year PFS rate of 75.1% and 3-year OS-rate of 77%, while patients with a very high-risk profile had a 2-year PFS-rate of 5.6% and 3-year OS-rate of 6.1% only [ 29 ]. The IPFSG score does not yet influence salvage treatment decision making but may be helpful for patient counselling with respect to prognosis and should be determined in every patient. In addition to the IPFSG score, the kinetics of serum tumor marker level decline within the first 6 weeks of salvage chemotherapy does predict outcomes [ 30 ] as it is the case for patients with primary metastatic disease undergoing first-line cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy (Table  2 ).

Conventional dose cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy with cisplatin, ifosfamide, and either paclitaxel (TIP) [ 32 ,  33 ], etoposide (VIP) [ 34 ] or vinblastine (VeIP) [ 35 ]) is currently the guideline-endorsed first salvage treatment option of choice [ 12 ,  14 ]. The complete secondarily resection of all visible residual masses, including those with a diameter < 1 cm, is essential for treatment success, particularly in non-seminoma patients, due to an increased frequency of residual viable GCT components resected post-salvage chemotherapy masses. TIP is the most frequently used combination, but randomized comparisons between either of these combinations are lacking. In a prospective study including 46 GCT patients at first relapse, 32 (70%) achieved a complete remission following TIP treatment (29 with TIP alone, 3 with subsequent complete residual mass resection), three of whom relapsed again. Interestingly, TIP was also very active in 14 late relapsing patients, of whom 50% achieved a CR following TIP ± secondary residual mass resection and no further relapses in the patients who achieved a CR. The 2-year PFS rate and 2-year OS rate were 65% (95 %CI 51–79%) and 78% (95% CI 66–90%) [ 33 ].

There are several retrospective studies and one prospective randomized clinical trial, which evaluated the activity of first salvage high-dose chemotherapy, to date. When salvage high-dose chemotherapy is chosen, the combination of carboplatin and etoposide is the combination of choice. Before dose-intensified treatment, mobilization chemotherapy, usually consisting of one or two cycles of paclitaxel and ifosfamide (TI), is applied prior stem cell apheresis. TIP seems to be inferior to TI with respect to stem mobilization capability [ 36 ]. In the only published randomized clinical trial so far, the IT-94 trial, a high-dose chemotherapy approach consisting of three cycles VeIP or VIP followed by a single consolidating cycle of HD-CE, was compared to four cycles of conventional salvage chemotherapy with VeIP or VIP [ 37 ]. Of 263 patients randomized, 128 received standard therapy and 135 patients high-dose chemotherapy. The objective response rate was insignificantly higher in the high-dose arm (67% versus 75%;  p  = 0.23), as was the 3-year PFS rate (55% versus 75%;  p  = 0.04), but without translation into an OS benefit (53% in both arms after 5 years). As prognostic factors for OS, primary tumor localization ( p  < 0.001), initial complete response ( p  = 0.009), absence of pulmonary metastases ( p  < 0.001), number of recurrences ( p  < 0.001), and LDH levels ( p  < 0.001) but not the kind of treatment ( p  = 0.92). Single high-dose chemotherapy has therefore not been adopted as standard salvage approach for relapsing advanced/metastatic GCTs. Instead, two different regimens of sequential high-dose treatment are commonly used: either two or three consecutive cycles of three days of HD-CE each followed by autologous stem cell transplantation with repetition after blood count recovery every 3–4 or 2–3 weeks, respectively [ 38 ,  39 ]. The Indiana University protocol consists of two cycles of carboplatin (700 mg/m 2 , days 1–3) and etoposide (700 mg/m 2 , days 1–3) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation after prior stem cell mobilization with granulocyte colony formation factor application and an optional preceding cycle of VeIP in case of disease progression or bulky disease [ 38 ]. In a recent retrospective study including 364 patients treated with salvage high-dose chemotherapy at first or second relapse at Indiana University, the 2-year PFS and OS rates were 60% (95% CI 55–65%) and 66% (95% CI 60–70%), respectively. High-dose treatment as first salvage resulted in a 2-year PFS rate of 63% (95% CI 57–68%) and as second salvage in a 2-year PFS of 49% (95% CI 36–61%). The treatment-related mortality was 2.5% [ 40 ]. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) protocol consists of two cycles of conventionally dosed mobilization chemotherapy with TI followed by three sequential cycles of carboplatin (AUC8, days 1–3) and etoposide (400 mg/m 2 , days 1–3) plus autologous stem cell transplantation on day 5 (TI-CE)[ 41 ]. In a prospective phase II study including 48 consecutive patients, complete remissions were achieved in 49% of patients with salvage TI-CE alone and a further 6% after secondary residual mass resection. 51% of patients were relapse-free after a median follow-up of 40 months [ 39 ] (also see Table  3 ). A following prospective analysis of 107 patients undergoing TI-CE as first or second salvage approach confirmed a complete remission rate of 50% with a 5-year disease-free survival and OS of 47% and 52%. All progression events after TI-CE occurred within 2 years from the start of salvage treatment [ 41 ]. Although a randomized comparison between sequential HD-CE and conventional chemotherapy is currently lacking, comparative retrospective studies suggest a beneficial impact of salvage HD-CE on patient survival. In the largest comparative assessment so far based on the IPFSG database, a post hoc matched subgroup analysis of 1594 patients found that patients of all five IPFSG subgroups benefitted from intensified first salvage treatment with sequential high-dose chemotherapy in terms of a 10–15% OS improvement. Across all risk groups, patients undergoing salvage high-dose chemotherapy had improved 2-year PFS and 5-year OS rates (PFS: HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.39–0.51; OS: HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.56–0.75) [ 31 ]. In another retrospective analysis of 95 patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy versus 48 patients receiving conventional salvage chemotherapy, the detected inferior PFS following conventional dose chemotherapy (8 versus 42 months,  p  < 0.001) was associated with a higher rate of vital tumor components in residual mass resection specimens (75% versus 44%). However, OS rates did not differ between both treatment groups ( p  = 0.931) [ 42 ]. Notably, patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy had worse prognostic factors, i.e., more frequent non-pulmonary visceral metastases ( p  = 0.032), HCG elevations ( p  = 0.022), and worse responses to first-line chemotherapy, which may account for the similar OS rates. In a more homogeneous, but even smaller retrospective matched-pair analysis published by Beyer et al. [ 43 ], a total of 55 patients relapsing after primary chemotherapy, who underwent conventional salvage chemotherapy were matched to 55 patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. A significant benefit with respect to PFS (HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.59–0.87;  p  < 0,001)) and OS (HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.61–0.92;  p  = 0,004)) was detected in favor of the high-dose salvage treatment approach. Several studies did assess the use of triplet high-dose chemotherapy combinations by adding a third drug, i.e., ifosfamide [ 44 ,  45 ], cyclophosphamide [ 46 ,  47 ], or thiotepa [ 36 ] resulting in added toxicity and increased treatment-related mortality. In a randomized trial, sequential high-dose chemotherapy with three cycles of HD-CE was compared to three conventional cycles of VIP and one cycle of high-dose CE plus cyclophosphamide (HD-CEC). Due to an unacceptable toxicity with a significantly increased treatment-related death rate in the investigational arm, the trial closed prematurely. Consequently, triplet combinations are not considered for high-dose chemotherapy in refractory GCT patients. Based on the limited level of evidence and the lack of prospective randomized trial results showing a clear benefit from dose-intensified salvage chemotherapy, the use of high-dose chemotherapy has not uniformly been adopted as first salvage standard of care for all patients, so far. However, conventional and high-dose chemotherapy are both acceptable options for first salvage treatment [ 14 ]. Still, the superiority of first salvage high-dose chemotherapy in terms of PFS and OS across almost all defined IPFSG risk groups in a large retrospective matched pair comparison is a strong surrogate of (i) the continued exceptional chemo sensitivity even of relapsed GCTs and (ii) the potential of high-dose chemotherapy to substantially improve patient outcomes. The German S3 Clinical Practice Guideline was the first to recommend first salvage high-dose chemotherapy as the preferred approach, particularly for patients with bone or brain metastases [ 15 ]. Whenever possible, relapsing patients should be included in clinical trials, i.e., the ongoing prospective phase III TIGER trial ( NCT02375204 ). In this trial, patients are being randomly assigned to either first salvage treatment with four cycles of conventional dose TIP or two cycles of TI followed for stem cell mobilization and subsequent high-dose chemotherapy with three consecutive cycles of carboplatin and etoposide plus autologous stem cell transplantation (TI-CE). This study will soon clarify whether or not dose-intensified treatment is superior to conventional dose chemotherapy in the first salvage setting. Generally, it is strongly recommended that GCT patients at first relapse are referred to GCT expert centers to provide expert advice on the optimal individual salvage approach and to minimize treatment-related mortality for those undergoing high-dose chemotherapy."

        "content": "In CS I and CS II non-seminomatous GCTs retroperitoneal lymph node dissection can be seen as a staging and curative approach [ 16 ]. Consequently, chemotherapy is not automatically the treatment of choice. In late relapses usually defined after a period of more than two years without tumor marker elevation or patients with a high percentage of teratomatous components in the primary have a significant increased risk of harboring pure teratoma in retroperitoneal manifestations [ 17 ,  18 ] with surgery being the standard of care. Further, to avoid side effects from systemic chemotherapy Hamilton et al. [ 19 ] described the results of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, which is generally recommended for tumor marker-negative late recurrences after chemotherapy. In this large retrospective analysis of prospectively collected patients this treatment approach was investigated in patients with recurrent disease on active surveillance. Of 580 patients with CS I non-seminomatous GCTs, 162 men relapsed during active surveillance. In retroperitoneal recurrences less than 3 cm in short axis diameter, tumor markers S0 and S1 with low doubling time (which is not described in detail), full bilateral nerve sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) was performed. In total, 45 patients (72.6%) of the patients were cured by RPLND alone. On multivariate analysis, only tumor marker elevation was an independent risk factor for subsequent additional treatment (HR6.05; 95%CI1.59–23.09;  p  < 0.0084). Only 17.8% of the patients with negative markers needed further treatment. Even in patients with elevated markers prior to surgery no additional treatment was necessary in half of the patients. There were no cancer-related deaths in the group, although the authors critically remark that those patients had a more favorable disease at relapse. The authors highlighted a significantly lower number of cumulative chemotherapy cycles with a primary RPLND at relapse, which was almost equal to patients who had received one cycle of adjuvant BEP [ 19 ]."

        "content": "Data on retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with seminoma concentrate on low volume disease in newly diagnosed disease. Due to the historic and retrospective character, trials are heterogeneous and difficult to interpret [ 20 – 22 ]. The relapse rates ranged from 0 to 67% depending on clinical stage. Patients who had CS I and IIA did not suffer in-field recurrences following surgical primary treatment, out-field relapses occurred in 7% [ 22 ]. Meanwhile, there are two prospective trials ongoing, SEMS-Trial, and PRIMETEST (NCT01537548;  NCT02797626 ) in patients with CS IIA-C seminoma. In the PRIMETEST study, not only primary disease cases but also relapses under active surveillance or following adjuvant chemotherapy were included. The rationale for both trials is to reduce the long-term morbidity of radiotherapy, the guideline-endorsed standard in CS IIA, or chemotherapy, the standard of care in clinical stage IIB, through salvage surgery. As no intensified chemotherapy had been applied earlier, there are no desmoplastic reactions; thus, the surgical risks and challenges are comparable to primary RPLND in non-seminomatous GCTs. In both trials, progression-free survival (at 2 or 3 years) is the primary endpoint. As secondary endpoints, quality of life and surgical complication rates are being assessed to obtain data on RPLND safety in low volume primary and recurrent seminoma with retroperitoneal spread only. An interim analysis of the German PRIMETEST trial was presented at the ASCO GU Meeting 2019 with promising results [ 23 ]. At this time, 14 patients had been included and after a median follow-up of 12.5 [ 3 – 25 ] months 4 relapses occurred. 12 of the 14 patients had either retroperitoneal progression on active surveillance ( n  = 10) or after adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin. Contrarily to historic data, predominantly patients with clinical stage IIA disease relapsed after RPLND. The SEMS trial highlighted a 2-year progression-free survival of 82% in 55 patients [ 24 ]. Compared to PRIMETEST only primary surgery was allowed, excluding relapses after adjuvant chemotherapy. The final results of the aforementioned two prospective clinical trials are expected and will probably strengthen the impact of RPLND in CS II seminomas at primary diagnosis and relapse from CS I disease. RPLND is a challenging surgery, in the primary setting as well as after chemotherapy in metastasized disease and even more in the salvage and desperation surgery situation. As clinical outcomes and negative side effects are significantly improved if performed by experienced surgeons, such kind of treatment should be performed in expert centers [ 19 ,  20 ,  25 ,  26 ]."

Interestingly, in a small retrospective study by Fischer et al., patients relapsing after one to two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) seemed to more frequently suffer late relapses than patients on active surveillance and to have inferior outcomes after systemic salvage treatment compared to historical cohorts of patients undergoing first-line combination chemotherapy for de novo metastatic disease [ 28 ]. Despite the fact that 84% of the analyzed patients had a good prognosis according to the IGCCCG classification at first relapse after adjuvant BEP, a second relapse rate of 29% is high. This was discussed to be likely associated with a selection for patients with chemoresistant disease and a delayed onset relapse, which are both known risk factors for unfavorable outcomes. Thus, adjuvant pre-treatment for CS I non-seminomatous disease may negatively impact the prognosis and success of systemic salvage treatment, but this so far does not imply different, i.e. more intensive, salvage treatment approaches. It should only be respected for patient consultation and planning of post-chemo follow-up."

Patients with a very low risk profile had a favorable 2-year PFS rate of 75.1% and 3-year OS-rate of 77%, while patients with a very high-risk profile had a 2-year PFS-rate of 5.6% and 3-year OS-rate of 6.1% only [ 29 ]. The IPFSG score does not yet influence salvage treatment decision making but may be helpful for patient counselling with respect to prognosis and should be determined in every patient.

Conventional dose cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy with cisplatin, ifosfamide, and either paclitaxel (TIP) [ 32 ,  33 ], etoposide (VIP) [ 34 ] or vinblastine (VeIP) [ 35 ]) is currently the guideline-endorsed first salvage treatment option of choice [ 12 ,  14 ]. The complete secondarily resection of all visible residual masses, including those with a diameter < 1 cm, is essential for treatment success, particularly in non-seminoma patients, due to an increased frequency of residual viable GCT components resected post-salvage chemotherapy masses. TIP is the most frequently used combination, but randomized comparisons between either of these combinations are lacking. In a prospective study including 46 GCT patients at first relapse, 32 (70%) achieved a complete remission following TIP treatment (29 with TIP alone, 3 with subsequent complete residual mass resection), three of whom relapsed again. Interestingly, TIP was also very active in 14 late relapsing patients, of whom 50% achieved a CR following TIP ± secondary residual mass resection and no further relapses in the patients who achieved a CR. The 2-year PFS rate and 2-year OS rate were 65% (95 %CI 51–79%) and 78% (95% CI 66–90%) [ 33 ].

        "content": "The use of salvage high-dose chemotherapy at first relapse of patients with primary metastatic disease is still a matter of debate. There are several retrospective studies and one prospective randomized clinical trial, which evaluated the activity of first salvage high-dose chemotherapy, to date. When salvage high-dose chemotherapy is chosen, the combination of carboplatin and etoposide is the combination of choice. Before dose-intensified treatment, mobilization chemotherapy, usually consisting of one or two cycles of paclitaxel and ifosfamide (TI), is applied prior stem cell apheresis. TIP seems to be inferior to TI with respect to stem mobilization capability [ 36 ]. In the only published randomized clinical trial so far, the IT-94 trial, a high-dose chemotherapy approach consisting of three cycles VeIP or VIP followed by a single consolidating cycle of HD-CE, was compared to four cycles of conventional salvage chemotherapy with VeIP or VIP [ 37 ]. Of 263 patients randomized, 128 received standard therapy and 135 patients high-dose chemotherapy. The objective response rate was insignificantly higher in the high-dose arm (67% versus 75%;  p  = 0.23), as was the 3-year PFS rate (55% versus 75%;  p  = 0.04), but without translation into an OS benefit (53% in both arms after 5 years). As prognostic factors for OS, primary tumor localization ( p  < 0.001), initial complete response ( p  = 0.009), absence of pulmonary metastases ( p  < 0.001), number of recurrences ( p  < 0.001), and LDH levels ( p  < 0.001) but not the kind of treatment ( p  = 0.92). Single high-dose chemotherapy has therefore not been adopted as standard salvage approach for relapsing advanced/metastatic GCTs. Instead, two different regimens of sequential high-dose treatment are commonly used: either two or three consecutive cycles of three days of HD-CE each followed by autologous stem cell transplantation with repetition after blood count recovery every 3–4 or 2–3 weeks, respectively [ 38 ,  39 ]. The Indiana University protocol consists of two cycles of carboplatin (700 mg/m 2 , days 1–3) and etoposide (700 mg/m 2 , days 1–3) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation after prior stem cell mobilization with granulocyte colony formation factor application and an optional preceding cycle of VeIP in case of disease progression or bulky disease [ 38 ]. In a recent retrospective study including 364 patients treated with salvage high-dose chemotherapy at first or second relapse at Indiana University, the 2-year PFS and OS rates were 60% (95% CI 55–65%) and 66% (95% CI 60–70%), respectively. High-dose treatment as first salvage resulted in a 2-year PFS rate of 63% (95% CI 57–68%) and as second salvage in a 2-year PFS of 49% (95% CI 36–61%). The treatment-related mortality was 2.5% [ 40 ]. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) protocol consists of two cycles of conventionally dosed mobilization chemotherapy with TI followed by three sequential cycles of carboplatin (AUC8, days 1–3) and etoposide (400 mg/m 2 , days 1–3) plus autologous stem cell transplantation on day 5 (TI-CE)[ 41 ]. In a prospective phase II study including 48 consecutive patients, complete remissions were achieved in 49% of patients with salvage TI-CE alone and a further 6% after secondary residual mass resection. 51% of patients were relapse-free after a median follow-up of 40 months [ 39 ] (also see Table  3 ). A following prospective analysis of 107 patients undergoing TI-CE as first or second salvage approach confirmed a complete remission rate of 50% with a 5-year disease-free survival and OS of 47% and 52%. All progression events after TI-CE occurred within 2 years from the start of salvage treatment [ 41 ].

Treatment recommendations comprise the standard first-line treatment for such stages at primary diagnosis without any adaption respecting possible prior adjuvant treatment after orchidectomy. First salvage treatment options for relapses after cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for primary advanced metastatic disease include both conventional dose cisplatin-based chemotherapy and salvage high-dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation. Although the only prospective randomized trial so far failed to demonstrate a survival benefit in patients receiving a single consolidation cycle of HD-CE, sequential HD-CE holds promise to substantially improve patient OS. Whenever GCT experts recommend the use of high-dose chemotherapy, two or three cycles of HD-CE represent the treatment of choice. Patients with testis cancer and recurrent disease are still treated with curative intention if treated properly. To achieve best treatment outcome patients need to be transferred to experienced centers to offer systemic treatment, timely surgical interventions, and treatment in clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Testicular cancer is a rare solid organ tumour associated with high cure rates and young age at diagnosis, hence it has a sizeable cohort of survivors worldwide. As it is one of the earliest tumours to be cured, a lot of studies have highlighted the late side effects of cancer and its different treatment modalities including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. While we are trying to identify the population at higher risk of platinum based chemotherapy and reduce its exposure, cisplatin based regimes remain an important tool to cure testicular cancer. The list of late side effects include a number of fatal and morbid conditions including but not limited to the second malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, hypogonadism, infertility, metabolic syndrome, chronic respiratory disease, renal insufficiency, hearing loss, peripheral neuropathy, infertility and psychological illnesses like stress and anxiety. These complications eventually result in compromised social and economic health as well as lower life expectancy compared to the normal population. This article provides a comprehensive review of the latest data regarding the late side effects in testicular cancer survivors. A review of these conditions can help us develop recommendations and guidelines to improve the morbidity and mortality in survivors of testicular cancer.",

        "content": "Testicular cancer (TC) is a rare tumour, accounting for only 1% of solid organ tumours, but its incidence has been increasing globally in the last two decades especially in the developed countries coupled with an improvement in mortality rates [ 1 ,  2 ]. Most of testicular cancers are germ cell tumours (97%) [ 3 ], usually diagnosed at an early age [ 4 ]. In general, the cure rates are around 95% [ 5 ], resulting in a large population of patients who will live for decades in the survivorship phase after the treatment of cancer. Different treatment modalities used in treatment, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, are all associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the survivorship setting. Most commonly reported conditions include second malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, persistent peripheral neuropathy, hypogonadism, chronic pulmonary disease, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity and psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression [ 6 – 8 ]. These late sequelae on one hand cause lower than normal life expectancy in TC survivors, while on the other hand severely affect their physical, social, psychological and economic health [ 7 ,  9 ]. Since the advent of cisplatin based chemotherapies in 1970s, cure rates have dramatically improved but late side effects in survivors still pose a big challenge for healthcare professionals [ 7 ,  10 ,  11 ]. In the last decade we have seen an abundant amount of research in this area. This increasing interest has generated an enormous amount of data which needs attention and review. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the incidence, prevalence and risk factors of the above mentioned complications. Similar review articles have established association of these complications with certain treatment modalities and risk factors [ 12 ]. We provide a thorough and complete landscape including all survivors and complications to help devise guidelines and care pathways."

        "content": "Over the last few years, efforts have been made to avoid exposure to platinum based chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with early stage cancers. In the section below we will briefly discuss current treatment options in TC. For stage I seminomas, active surveillance after orchiectomy is recommended especially in the absence of risk factors, as only 15–20% of the patients experience the recurrence of disease [ 13 ,  14 ]. Known risk factors for recurrence of cancer in seminomas after orchiectomy include tumour size of more than 4 cm and involvement of rete testes or small vessels [ 13 – 15 ]. The risk of recurrence can be substantially reduced with one cycle of carboplatin in the adjuvant setting [ 13 ,  16 ,  17 ]. In stage I non-seminomatous germ cell tumours(NSGCT), the presence of lymph vascular invasion (LVI) or an embryonal component (EC) is associated with a higher risk of relapse after orchiectomy [ 14 ,  18 ]. In general the risk of relapse is around 30% at 5 years after orchiectomy alone, but in presence of risk factors it can rise up to 50% compared to only 12% without them [ 14 ,  19 ]. One cycle of chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) can been used in stage I NSGCT [ 20 ,  21 ]. BEP given in one cycle after orchiectomy has shown to reduce the risk of recurrence compared to surveillance [ 20 – 23 ]. For stage IIA/IIB seminoma, both radiation and chemotherapy can be used, though chemotherapy is preferred as the latter results in a higher incidence of second malignant disease [ 14 ,  24 ]. Radiotherapy is usually given to the para-aortic and ipsilateral iliac lymph nodes and demonstrates excellent relapse-free survival (IIA 95.3%, IIB 88.9% at 6 years) [ 25 ]. For chemotherapy, three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin or four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) are recommended as preferred regimens with estimated five-year progression-free survival rates of 100% for IIA and 87% for IIB [ 14 ,  26 ]. Due to concerns regarding late side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, primary RPLND is being evaluated as an alternative [ 27 ] but definitive data on efficacy is not available yet. In the case of NSGCT stage IIA/IIB disease, it is recommended to either treat the patient upfront with chemotherapy or consider RPLND with adjuvant chemotherapy [ 28 ]. RPLND alone is not recommended due to high rate of recurrence especially in patients with elevated serum tumour markers [ 28 ]. Chemotherapy when given as primary treatment is prescribed according to the prognostic risk category [ 14 ]. Stage IIC and III of both seminomas and NSGCTs is treated as metastatic disease with chemotherapy based on IGCCCG prognostic risk groups [ 29 ]. In 2021, IGCCCG revised the prognostic groups by upgrading the overall survival of all risk groups and adding LDH as prognostic marker [ 29 ]. Metastatic seminomas are less common than NSGCT but carries better prognosis [ 14 ]. For good prognostic group three cycles of BEP (Bleomycin, Etoposide, Cisplatin) [ 14 ,  30 ,  31 ] or 4 cycles of EP (etoposide, cisplatin) have shown excellent results. Although BEP has been proven very effective with 2-year progression free survival of 90%, risk of pulmonary toxicity remains a concern [ 14 ,  30 ,  31 ]. Four cycles of EP can be safely used as an alternative if bleomycin is contraindicated [ 14 ,  31 ]. For intermediate group metastatic seminoma, four cycles of BEP or four cycles of etoposide, ifosfamide and cisplatin (VIP) can be used [ 32 ]. A summary of the recommended treatment options for seminoma and NSGCT are shown in Figs.  1  and  2 . Fig. 1 Management of seminoma germ cell tumours Management of seminoma germ cell tumours In good risk stage IIC and III NSGCT, either three cycles of BEP or four cycles of EP are recommended. R de Wit et, al. when compared the two, reported higher rates of complete response with BEP (95%) than EP(87%), but also a higher incidence of pulmonary toxicity, neurotoxicity and Raynaud’s phenomenon with bleomycin [ 30 ]. Fig. 2 Management of non-seminomatous germ cell tumours Management of non-seminomatous germ cell tumours Given the better outcomes with BEP, replacing it with EP remains controversial. Current NCCN guidelines advise caution in patients more than 50 years of age, diminished renal function or underlying lung disease e.g., COPD [ 33 ]. Some oncologists use four cycles of EP in active smokers regardless of lung function [ 33 ]. Monitoring of DLCO and radiological changes have also been advocated, but the exact threshold prompting dose reduction of bleomycin is not clear yet [ 34 ,  35 ]. The role of concomitant use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors (GCSF) with bleomycin also needs further investigation. Data suggesting detrimental effect of GCSF with bleomycin mainly comes from animal models [ 36 ]. On the contrary, a retrospective study conducted in Australia, failed to establish any increased incidence of pulmonary complications with GCSF use [ 37 ]. While we wait for stronger evidence in this area, a shared decision between physician and patient is recommended [ 33 ]. Similar to seminomas, intermediate group NSGCT can be effectively treated with 4 cycles of BEP or 4 cycles of VIP [ 14 ,  38 ]. VIP should be used with GCSF support to mitigate bone marrow toxicity. VIP doesn’t provide superior outcomes compared to BEP and should only be used where bleomycin needs to be avoided [ 14 ,  38 ]. Metastatic NSGCT in poor prognostic group carries 5-year overall survival of only 67% [ 29 ]. At present 4 cycles of BEP or VIP are widely used to treat this group of patients as no other treatment regimen successfully improved the outcomes [ 14 ,  39 ,  40 ]. However, intensification of treatment is recommended after initial BEP based on decline in serum tumour markers according to GETUG-13 phase 3 results [ 41 ]. Recurrence after initial chemotherapy can be treated with high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous stem cell transplant [ 42 ,  43 ]. Other treatment options include chemotherapy combinations like TIP (Paclitaxel, Ifosfamide, Cisplatin) [ 44 ] and GIP (gemcitabine, Ifosfamide, cisplatin) [ 45 ]. A prospective study (TIGER trial), currently in progress, will provide important information regarding efficacy of standard vs. high dose chemotherapy in this setting [ 46 ]. The International Prognostic Factor Study Group (IPFSG) has highlighted prognostic markers and estimated overall survival after recurrence of testicular cancer in a meta-analysis published in 2010 [ 47 ]."

        "section_name": "Relative survival and morbidity in TCS",
        "content": "Kvammen et al. in 2016 published a registry analysis of survival in TCS compared to the general population [ 9 ]. Patients diagnosed after the advent of cisplatin based chemotherapy in 1976 experienced a dramatic improvement in prognosis and survival. Unfortunately, their analysis also highlights that these gains didn’t last long, as the survival began to fall after 20–30 years of diagnosis. While the life expectancy of the general population has improved in last 50 years, it has worsened for TCS. Another analysis was performed to identify the causes of excess mortality in TCS [ 8 ]. Non-testicular second malignancies were identified as the most common cause of death after 5 years of diagnosis while TC remained the major cause of death before 5 years. Cardiovascular events were the second most common cause of mortality after 5 years of diagnosis. Higher incidence of adverse health outcomes (AHO) was reported by Agrawal et al. in patients receiving chemotherapy compared to patients who were treated with surgery only [ 6 ]. Incidence of AHO increased with increasing the cycles of chemotherapy mainly BEP. In Platinum study [ 7 ] around 1200 patients, who had received platinum based chemotherapy were assessed for cumulative burden of morbidity (CBM). At median follow up of 4.2 years, 20% of patients had a high or very high score of CBM with another 30% having a medium score. The most common AHOs identified were obesity, neurotoxicity, ototoxicity and Raynaud’s phenomenon."

        "section_name": "Long term complications in TCS",
        "content": "A brief list of late side effects in TCS is given in Table  1 . In the headings below, we a provide detailed discussion on the major complications. Second malignancy is the most common cause of death in TCS after 5 years of diagnosis [ 8 ]. Patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy are at greater risk of developing second cancers compared to those who had surgery only [ 48 ]. Also, more than 35 years of age at diagnosis carries a higher risk of developing cancer later in life [ 3 ]. With infra-diaphragmatic radiotherapy, risk increased by 2.6-fold, while with chemotherapy by 2.1-fold [ 48 ]. Relative risk is highest (2.9) among those who received both chemotherapy and radiotherapy [ 3 ]. A diverse set of malignancies including mesotheliomas, lung, thyroid, GI, GU and skin cancers are reported in large registry based studies [ 3 ,  8 ,  49 ]. Ondrus et al. reported testicular cancer as the most common second malignancy succeeded by prostate and kidney cancer [ 50 ]. A higher incidence of SMN was reported in patients who had seminoma as primary diagnosis. Groot et al. in 2018 analysed registry data of around 6000 Dutch patients. They showed that compared to the general population TCS are at 1.8 fold higher risk of developing second cancers [ 49 ]. In this study, a higher risk was found in non-seminomas compared to seminomas. Infra-diaphragmatic radiotherapy increases the risk of abdominal solid organ tumours, particularly those covered in the radiation field [ 49 ]. Radiotherapy is associated with an increased risk of stomach, pancreas, kidney, bladder, melanoma and squamous cell cancer [ 49 ]. Same study observed a linear association, with every Gray (Gy) of radiation increasing risk of second malignancy by 8% [ 49 ]. Dog-leg irradiation of more than 26 Gy raises the risk of non-colorectal GI cancers by 9.99 fold [ 49 ]. This increased risk of SMNs persists for 25 years after treatment [ 49 ]. In the same analysis performed by Groot et al. a higher incidence of GI cancers was reported among patients who received cisplatin based chemotherapy without radiotherapy [ 49 ]. A higher risk of solid organ malignancy (HR 2.40) including colorectal (HR 3.85) and non-colorectal cancers (HR 5.0) was observed with chemotherapy compared to surgery only. Increasing the dose of cisplatin resulted in a higher risk of malignancies [ 49 ]. Myeloid dysplasia and leukaemia are associated with both radiotherapy and chemotherapy [ 3 ,  51 ] with the majority of cases between 5 and 8 years after treatment [ 51 ,  52 ]. Travis et al. performed a comprehensive study capturing around 18,000 patients from US and Europe to investigate this subject in 2000. Radiotherapy alone without any chemotherapy increased the risk of developing leukaemia by 3 fold [ 51 ]. Radiotherapy to the chest (active bone marrow) in a dose of more than 19.5 Gy increases the risk by 11 fold. However, the relative risk was only 2.2 when radiation was limited to abdomen and pelvis [ 51 ]. Cisplatin and etoposide increases the predictive risk of leukaemia by 3.2 [ 51 ]. A higher risk of acute myeloid leukaemia is associated with chemotherapy [ 53 ] compared to radiotherapy alone. In particular, etoposide is known to be associated with the risk of developing secondary acute leukaemia [ 54 ]. To reduce the exposure of radiation used in surveillance CT scans, MRI abdomen is being investigated as an alternative [ 55 – 57 ]. So far, studies have successfully demonstrated non-inferiority of MRI to detect the recurrence of cancer specifically after stage I seminoma (TRISST study) [ 55 – 57 ]. In future MRI might become preferred modality for surveillance in TC patients. A recent study conducted in the Netherlands, published in Journal of Clinical Oncology in July 2023, assessed cardiovascular disease (CVD) in TCS [ 58 ]. With a median follow up of 16 years, 5.73% patients had developed cardiovascular complications. TCS who received cisplatin had a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (HR 1.9) compared to orchiectomy alone. Even higher risks were found in patients who were smokers/obese (HR 4.6), had dyslipidaemia (HR 2.8) or a positive family history (HR 2.9). Chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy posed even higher risk (HR 2.5) but radiotherapy alone was not found to be a risk factor for CVD (HR 1.1). Furthermore, patients who developed CVD showed lower quality of life (QoL) than other TCS [ 58 ]. Another Danish study including around 5000 TCS reported a high risk of myocardial infarction (HR 6.3), cerebrovascular accident (HR 6.0) and venous thromboembolism (HR 24.7) during first year of chemotherapy with BEP [ 59 ]. Interestingly, the same study reported no added risk of CVD in TCS when they had surveillance and risk factors controlled. Cardiac complications are a major cause of mortality in TCS [ 60 ]. Cisplatin and bleomycin based chemotherapy causes damage to the endothelium and increases the levels of Von Willebrand Factor, which in turn can explain the long term cardiovascular complications [ 61 ,  62 ]. Available data suggests that increased inflammatory markers and microalbuminuria in TCS are could be an early sign of atherosclerosis [ 63 ] Regarding structural abnormalities, a higher incidence of diastolic dysfunction was found in TCS patients treated with cisplatin, although ejection fraction and systolic function were preserved [ 64 ]. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of disorders including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity and diabetes. It is a well-established major risk factor for cardiovascular disease [ 65 ]. A higher incidence of metabolic syndrome has been reported in TCS [ 66 ], particularly in patients with underlying hypogonadism [ 67 ]. The Platinum study also reported metabolic syndrome as a major cluster of co-morbidities in TCS after chemotherapy exposure (OR 9.8) [ 7 ]. In a Dutch study evaluating 304 TCS for cardiovascular risk factors, an alarming 86% were found to have dyslipidaemia of which 82% were untreated [ 58 ]. High levels of LDL (82%) and/or high levels of total cholesterol (55%) constituted the majority of cases. The same study reported 50% of TCS with underlying hypertension, of which only 48% was treated. Several other investigators have reported hypertension as a major undiagnosed complication in TCS [ 6 ,  7 ,  68 ]. During a major multi-institutional study to assess the cumulative burden of morbidity (CBM) after platinum based chemotherapy (PBCT), 41.7% TCS were found to have grade 2 obesity while 26% had grade 3 and 3.9% had grade 4 obesity(total 71.5%) [ 7 ]. Agarwal et al. also reported more than double (3.2% Vs 7.7%) the incidence of morbid obesity (BMI > 40) in patients treated with BEP compared to surgery alone [ 6 ]. Another study investigating CVD risk factors after PBCT, revealed an increase in visceral adipose tissue to subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT -to- SAT ratio) after administration of chemotherapy. The resulting central adiposity leads to a higher incidence of cardiometabolic conditions [ 69 ]. At a median follow up of 4 years, 3% TCS were found to have diabetes [ 7 ]. However, studies comparing chemotherapy and orchiectomy have reported similar incidence of pre-diabetes and diabetes in both groups [ 6 ,  58 ]. Hypogonadism is a broad term to suggest loss of testicular function. It includes hormonal deficiency and disturbance in spermatogenesis [ 70 ]. In this section we will focus on dysregulation in gonadal hormones, while spermatogenesis will be discussed under the heading of infertility. Most of the studies investigating TCS define gonadal dysfunction as low serum testosterone (< 10) and compensatory high LH/FSH with clinical manifestations of low testosterone such as erectile dysfunction, low libido and gynecomastia [ 58 ,  71 ]. It is important to make age related adjustments in the normal range when assessing these patients [ 72 ]. A higher incidence of hypogonadism, requiring testosterone treatment, is associated with cisplatin based chemotherapy compared to surgery alone(12.0% Vs 8.2%) [ 6 ]. Also, a higher incidence (28.4%) of erectile dysfunction has been reported after chemotherapy [ 7 ]. Cisplatin is known to damage Leydig cells which can cause this gonadal insufficiency in these patients [ 73 ]. A longitudinal study spanning over two decades and assessing hormonal levels in TCS, reported low levels of testosterone in all TCS independent of treatment modality. However, fewer patients in chemotherapy cohort recovered their hormonal levels, after 18 years of treatment, compared to surgery and radiotherapy [ 71 ]. Compared to healthy control group, the odds ratio for low testosterone level after 18 years was 2.1, 2.7 and 3.7 with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy respectively [ 71 ]. Another study looking at hormonal levels in the first 5 years of treatment showed the highest incidence of hypogonadism at 6–12 months after orchiectomy. At 5 years follow up 25% remained hypogonadal while the rest recovered. Microlithiasis in the remaining testis and treatment with chemotherapy were found to be important risk factors for developing hypogonadism [ 74 ]. These reduced levels of serum testosterone and raised LH are associated with reduced bone mineral density in TCS population, causing osteopenia and osteoporosis [ 75 ]. A UK randomised trial has shown the benefit of testosterone replacement in young cancer survivors (88% testicular cancer) by improving whole body fat and truncal fat [ 76 ]. Unfortunately, no benefit was noticed in QoL (SF36-PF, EORTC QLQc30) with testosterone replacement [ 76 ,  77 ]. Bleomycin is strongly associated with acute and chronic lung injury [ 78 ] as it causes alveolar damage which subsequently triggers pulmonary inflammation [ 79 ]. Some studies suggest that this dose dependent injury can be prevented by reducing BEP cycles in favourable prognosis tumours from four to three [ 80 ], but it remains debatable as we mentioned earlier in treatment section. For delayed toxicity of bleomycin, a Danish study recorded the pulmonary function tests (PFTs) of 565 patients who received treatment with BEP. Only one death was recorded of a 45 years old non-smoker, who died of acute bleomycin induced pneumonitis after 3 cycles of BEP. Data at 5-years follow up showed long term restrictive disease in 4.1%, obstructive disease in 2.7% and impaired diffusion capacity in 15.6% patients but 16-years follow up didn’t show any significant difference in lung function compared to patients who had surgery only. Pulmonary surgery, pulmonary embolism, smoking and reduced GFR were identified as risk factors for reduced lung function following BEP [ 81 ]. It is important to note that, HFE gene variant H63D is found to be associated with a higher risk of bleomycin induced pulmonary toxicity [ 82 ]. High doses of cisplatin especially when accompanied with pulmonary surgery can also cause long term lung injury [ 83 ]. In TCS, Raynaud’s phenomenon is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and compromised QoL [ 58 ]. Its incidence in TCS is related to dose of bleomycin and cisplatin [ 6 ,  7 ]. In patients who received three cycles of BEP, the risk is increased by 12-fold and with 4 cycles of BEP by 21-fold compared to surgery alone [ 6 ]. For every 90,000IU of Bleomycin the risk increases by OR of 1.36 [ 6 ]. Cisplatin and Carboplatin also increase the risk in a dose dependent manner [ 84 ]. A multi-institutional study performed clinical assessment of more than 1200 TCS, who had received platinum based chemotherapy. They observed Raynaud’s Phenomenon in 33% of patients, including 15.6% with grade 1, 8.7% with grade 2 and 9.1% with grade 3 disease [ 7 ]. Ototoxicity is one of the most frequently reported long term complications in TCS especially after platinum based chemotherapy [ 6 ,  7 ]. Kern et al. found hearing loss and tinnitus in almost 40% of TCS at 4 years follow up [ 7 ]. Another study reported the rate of hearing loss with surgery alone as 11.5%, compared to 36.0% with BEP 3 and 41.8% with BEP 4 [ 6 ]. Increasing the cumulative dose of Cisplatin by 100mg/m 2  increases the risk by 1.4-fold. Hearing impairment is mainly in higher frequency ranges [ 85 ]. Hearing loss and tinnitus have frequently been reported as reason for unemployment and low QoL in TCS [ 11 ]. At a median follow up of 4 years, 3.3% patients who received platinum based chemotherapy were found to have renal impairment compared to 0% who underwent surgery alone [ 6 ]. Even though hyperhydration has reduced the incidence of renal injury after cisplatin, yet a long term reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 20–30% has been reported in almost a quarter of TCS [ 86 ]. Ifosfamide and aminoglycosides are other factors causing nephrotoxicity in TCS, with highest risk in those who received high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) in second line setting [ 86 ]. Elevated blood pressure and mild renal impairment before treatment are risk factors for developing long term nephrotoxicity [ 87 ]. Like ototoxicity and Raynaud’s Phenomenon, kidney disease is also a major contributor to unemployment and disability leave in TCS [ 11 ].

Some studies have implicated certain genetic variations as risk factors for developing peripheral neuropathy after cisplatin [ 88 ]. Other risk factors include renal impairment, smoking and peripheral vascular disease [ 89 ]. Long term follow up has shown elevated serum platinum levels in TCS for up to 20 years, resulting in neurotoxicity along with ototoxicity, Raynaud’s Phenomenon and cardiovascular disease [ 90 ]. Peripheral as well as autonomic neuropathy are documented as a major factors contributing to higher incidence of unemployment and disability leave in TCS [ 11 ]. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases is found in 1–2% of patients of germ cell cancers [ 91 ]. They are usually treated with combined whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and chemotherapy [ 92 ]. As germ cell tumours can be cured even with brain metastases, long term consequences of WBRT have been widely reported. These include delayed symptoms of seizures, headaches, blindness, dementia and hemiparesis secondary to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. D.M. Doyle et al. followed up 5 patients at 72 months after treatment with WBRT and found CNS gliosis and cerebral atrophy in all of them [ 93 ]. A recently published systemic review showed anxiety as the most common psychological problem in TCS. Most of the reviewed studies reported a anxiety in 20% of TCS after more than 5 years of follow up [ 94 ]. Although levels of depression and distress were similar to the general population, fear of recurrence of cancer was highly prevalent (33%) among them. Risk factors for psychological complications are single status, unemployment, low socioeconomic status, co-morbidities and presence of symptoms or side effects [ 94 ]. A Danish study reported higher levels of stress in TCS (OR 1.56) compared to the general population [ 95 ]. Another study reported a higher incidence of mental health services use in TCS during perioperative period continuing over 12 years of follow up [ 96 ]. Physical activity is found to be beneficial for psychological side effects in TCS, as it reduces the risk [ 97 ]. Registry based studies have reported a higher risk of suicide in TCS (HR 2.5) compared to cancer free population [ 98 ] and even higher risk with cisplatin based chemotherapy treatment [ 99 ]. Of note, suicide risk in TCS increases with follow up time, contrary to the trends of suicide in other cancers which decreases over time [ 100 ]. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide compared to general population stands at 6 within first year, 12 from year 1 to 5 and 17 from year 5 onwards [ 100 ]. A multi-institutional study of more than 1800 TCS showed 2.4% rate of disability and 6.8% of unemployment at median age of 37. Peripheral sensory neuropathy, renal dysfunction, pain and higher cumulative burden of morbidity (CBM) score were associated with these outcomes [ 11 ]. Compared to the normal population, the odds ratio for unemployment was 2.67 [ 11 ]. In another study of 562 TCS, 4 or more cycles of chemotherapy were associated with more chances of financial toxicity (OR 4.17) [ 101 ]. TCS are less likely to father a child compared to the general population, particularly when diagnosed before age of 25 (HR 0.77). Multiple factors are involved in causing infertility in TCS. Almost half of newly diagnosed TC patients have a low sperm count (< 20 million/mL), low motility indices (< 40%) and high percentage of abnormal cells (> 80%) even before starting any treatment [ 102 ]. These findings explain the disappointing results with semen cryopreservation which is currently offered to all young patients before treatment. Orchiectomy reduces the quality of semen [ 103 ] and addition of cisplatin based chemotherapies further damage the gonadal function in a dose dependent manner [ 104 ]. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection can cause retrograde ejaculation but nerve sparing techniques can be used to reduce the risk [ 105 ]. In addition to the list above, a lot more complications are reported in the literature including thyroid disease, vertigo, peripheral vascular disease, substance abuse and chronic pain [ 6 ,  7 ]. A higher risk of hypothyroidism in TCS was reported in a Norwegian study, compared to general population, after three decades of treatment [ 106 ]. Of note, same study didn’t find any association with a particular treatment modality. Other studies have also reported similar findings [ 6 ,  7 ,  107 ]. Similar to cardiovascular disease, endothelial damage caused by cisplatin based chemotherapies is associated with the peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in survivors [ 108 ]. Therefore, a higher incidence of PVD is reported in studies assessing co-morbidities in TCS population [ 6 ,  7 ]. Substance abuse, chronic pain, fatigue and neuroticism in TCS has been widely described in literature. These conditions can negatively impact social, economic and sexual health of TCS [ 109 ]. Phantom testis syndrome is well recognised condition in patients after orchiectomy [ 110 ,  111 ]. A survey questionnaire conducted in University of Münster, investigated 238 TCS after a median 3.5 years of unilateral inguinal orchiectomy [ 111 ]. When 47% respondents didn’t report any symptoms, 25% reported phantom testis pain, 16% reported painless phantom sensation and 12% reported male gonad hallucinations [ 111 ]."

        "content": "Second malignancy is the most common cause of death in TCS after 5 years of diagnosis [ 8 ]. Patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy are at greater risk of developing second cancers compared to those who had surgery only [ 48 ]. Also, more than 35 years of age at diagnosis carries a higher risk of developing cancer later in life [ 3 ]. With infra-diaphragmatic radiotherapy, risk increased by 2.6-fold, while with chemotherapy by 2.1-fold [ 48 ]. Relative risk is highest (2.9) among those who received both chemotherapy and radiotherapy [ 3 ]. A diverse set of malignancies including mesotheliomas, lung, thyroid, GI, GU and skin cancers are reported in large registry based studies [ 3 ,  8 ,  49 ]. Ondrus et al. reported testicular cancer as the most common second malignancy succeeded by prostate and kidney cancer [ 50 ]. A higher incidence of SMN was reported in patients who had seminoma as primary diagnosis. Groot et al. in 2018 analysed registry data of around 6000 Dutch patients. They showed that compared to the general population TCS are at 1.8 fold higher risk of developing second cancers [ 49 ]. In this study, a higher risk was found in non-seminomas compared to seminomas. Infra-diaphragmatic radiotherapy increases the risk of abdominal solid organ tumours, particularly those covered in the radiation field [ 49 ]. Radiotherapy is associated with an increased risk of stomach, pancreas, kidney, bladder, melanoma and squamous cell cancer [ 49 ]. Same study observed a linear association, with every Gray (Gy) of radiation increasing risk of second malignancy by 8% [ 49 ]. Dog-leg irradiation of more than 26 Gy raises the risk of non-colorectal GI cancers by 9.99 fold [ 49 ]. This increased risk of SMNs persists for 25 years after treatment [ 49 ]. In the same analysis performed by Groot et al. a higher incidence of GI cancers was reported among patients who received cisplatin based chemotherapy without radiotherapy [ 49 ]. A higher risk of solid organ malignancy (HR 2.40) including colorectal (HR 3.85) and non-colorectal cancers (HR 5.0) was observed with chemotherapy compared to surgery only. Increasing the dose of cisplatin resulted in a higher risk of malignancies [ 49 ]. Myeloid dysplasia and leukaemia are associated with both radiotherapy and chemotherapy [ 3 ,  51 ] with the majority of cases between 5 and 8 years after treatment [ 51 ,  52 ]. Travis et al. performed a comprehensive study capturing around 18,000 patients from US and Europe to investigate this subject in 2000. Radiotherapy alone without any chemotherapy increased the risk of developing leukaemia by 3 fold [ 51 ]. Radiotherapy to the chest (active bone marrow) in a dose of more than 19.5 Gy increases the risk by 11 fold. However, the relative risk was only 2.2 when radiation was limited to abdomen and pelvis [ 51 ]. Cisplatin and etoposide increases the predictive risk of leukaemia by 3.2 [ 51 ]. A higher risk of acute myeloid leukaemia is associated with chemotherapy [ 53 ] compared to radiotherapy alone. In particular, etoposide is known to be associated with the risk of developing secondary acute leukaemia [ 54 ]. To reduce the exposure of radiation used in surveillance CT scans, MRI abdomen is being investigated as an alternative [ 55 – 57 ]. So far, studies have successfully demonstrated non-inferiority of MRI to detect the recurrence of cancer specifically after stage I seminoma (TRISST study) [ 55 – 57 ]. In future MRI might become preferred modality for surveillance in TC patients."

        "content": "A recent study conducted in the Netherlands, published in Journal of Clinical Oncology in July 2023, assessed cardiovascular disease (CVD) in TCS [ 58 ]. With a median follow up of 16 years, 5.73% patients had developed cardiovascular complications. TCS who received cisplatin had a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (HR 1.9) compared to orchiectomy alone. Even higher risks were found in patients who were smokers/obese (HR 4.6), had dyslipidaemia (HR 2.8) or a positive family history (HR 2.9). Chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy posed even higher risk (HR 2.5) but radiotherapy alone was not found to be a risk factor for CVD (HR 1.1). Furthermore, patients who developed CVD showed lower quality of life (QoL) than other TCS [ 58 ]. Another Danish study including around 5000 TCS reported a high risk of myocardial infarction (HR 6.3), cerebrovascular accident (HR 6.0) and venous thromboembolism (HR 24.7) during first year of chemotherapy with BEP [ 59 ]. Interestingly, the same study reported no added risk of CVD in TCS when they had surveillance and risk factors controlled. Cardiac complications are a major cause of mortality in TCS [ 60 ]. Cisplatin and bleomycin based chemotherapy causes damage to the endothelium and increases the levels of Von Willebrand Factor, which in turn can explain the long term cardiovascular complications [ 61 ,  62 ]. Available data suggests that increased inflammatory markers and microalbuminuria in TCS are could be an early sign of atherosclerosis [ 63 ] Regarding structural abnormalities, a higher incidence of diastolic dysfunction was found in TCS patients treated with cisplatin, although ejection fraction and systolic function were preserved [ 64 ]."

It is a well-established major risk factor for cardiovascular disease [ 65 ]. A higher incidence of metabolic syndrome has been reported in TCS [ 66 ], particularly in patients with underlying hypogonadism [ 67 ]. The Platinum study also reported metabolic syndrome as a major cluster of co-morbidities in TCS after chemotherapy exposure (OR 9.8) [ 7 ]. In a Dutch study evaluating 304 TCS for cardiovascular risk factors, an alarming 86% were found to have dyslipidaemia of which 82% were untreated [ 58 ]. High levels of LDL (82%) and/or high levels of total cholesterol (55%) constituted the majority of cases. The same study reported 50% of TCS with underlying hypertension, of which only 48% was treated. Several other investigators have reported hypertension as a major undiagnosed complication in TCS [ 6 ,  7 ,  68 ]. During a major multi-institutional study to assess the cumulative burden of morbidity (CBM) after platinum based chemotherapy (PBCT), 41.7% TCS were found to have grade 2 obesity while 26% had grade 3 and 3.9% had grade 4 obesity(total 71.5%) [ 7 ]. Agarwal et al. also reported more than double (3.2% Vs 7.7%) the incidence of morbid obesity (BMI > 40) in patients treated with BEP compared to surgery alone [ 6 ]. Another study investigating CVD risk factors after PBCT, revealed an increase in visceral adipose tissue to subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT -to- SAT ratio) after administration of chemotherapy. The resulting central adiposity leads to a higher incidence of cardiometabolic conditions [ 69 ]. At a median follow up of 4 years, 3% TCS were found to have diabetes [ 7 ]. However, studies comparing chemotherapy and orchiectomy have reported similar incidence of pre-diabetes and diabetes in both groups [ 6 ,  58 ]."

        "content": "Hypogonadism is a broad term to suggest loss of testicular function. It includes hormonal deficiency and disturbance in spermatogenesis [ 70 ]. In this section we will focus on dysregulation in gonadal hormones, while spermatogenesis will be discussed under the heading of infertility. Most of the studies investigating TCS define gonadal dysfunction as low serum testosterone (< 10) and compensatory high LH/FSH with clinical manifestations of low testosterone such as erectile dysfunction, low libido and gynecomastia [ 58 ,  71 ]. It is important to make age related adjustments in the normal range when assessing these patients [ 72 ]. A higher incidence of hypogonadism, requiring testosterone treatment, is associated with cisplatin based chemotherapy compared to surgery alone(12.0% Vs 8.2%) [ 6 ]. Also, a higher incidence (28.4%) of erectile dysfunction has been reported after chemotherapy [ 7 ]. Cisplatin is known to damage Leydig cells which can cause this gonadal insufficiency in these patients [ 73 ]. A longitudinal study spanning over two decades and assessing hormonal levels in TCS, reported low levels of testosterone in all TCS independent of treatment modality. However, fewer patients in chemotherapy cohort recovered their hormonal levels, after 18 years of treatment, compared to surgery and radiotherapy [ 71 ]. Compared to healthy control group, the odds ratio for low testosterone level after 18 years was 2.1, 2.7 and 3.7 with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy respectively [ 71 ]. Another study looking at hormonal levels in the first 5 years of treatment showed the highest incidence of hypogonadism at 6–12 months after orchiectomy. At 5 years follow up 25% remained hypogonadal while the rest recovered. Microlithiasis in the remaining testis and treatment with chemotherapy were found to be important risk factors for developing hypogonadism [ 74 ]. These reduced levels of serum testosterone and raised LH are associated with reduced bone mineral density in TCS population, causing osteopenia and osteoporosis [ 75 ]. A UK randomised trial has shown the benefit of testosterone replacement in young cancer survivors (88% testicular cancer) by improving whole body fat and truncal fat [ 76 ]. Unfortunately, no benefit was noticed in QoL (SF36-PF, EORTC QLQc30) with testosterone replacement [ 76 ,  77 ]."

Some studies suggest that this dose dependent injury can be prevented by reducing BEP cycles in favourable prognosis tumours from four to three [ 80 ], but it remains debatable as we mentioned earlier in treatment section. For delayed toxicity of bleomycin, a Danish study recorded the pulmonary function tests (PFTs) of 565 patients who received treatment with BEP. Only one death was recorded of a 45 years old non-smoker, who died of acute bleomycin induced pneumonitis after 3 cycles of BEP. Data at 5-years follow up showed long term restrictive disease in 4.1%, obstructive disease in 2.7% and impaired diffusion capacity in 15.6% patients but 16-years follow up didn’t show any significant difference in lung function compared to patients who had surgery only. Pulmonary surgery, pulmonary embolism, smoking and reduced GFR were identified as risk factors for reduced lung function following BEP [ 81 ]. It is important to note that, HFE gene variant H63D is found to be associated with a higher risk of bleomycin induced pulmonary toxicity [ 82 ]. High doses of cisplatin especially when accompanied with pulmonary surgery can also cause long term lung injury [ 83 ]."

For every 90,000IU of Bleomycin the risk increases by OR of 1.36 [ 6 ]. Cisplatin and Carboplatin also increase the risk in a dose dependent manner [ 84 ]. A multi-institutional study performed clinical assessment of more than 1200 TCS, who had received platinum based chemotherapy.

Ifosfamide and aminoglycosides are other factors causing nephrotoxicity in TCS, with highest risk in those who received high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) in second line setting [ 86 ]. Elevated blood pressure and mild renal impairment before treatment are risk factors for developing long term nephrotoxicity [ 87 ]. Like ototoxicity and Raynaud’s Phenomenon, kidney disease is also a major contributor to unemployment and disability leave in TCS [ 11 ].

Some studies have implicated certain genetic variations as risk factors for developing peripheral neuropathy after cisplatin [ 88 ]. Other risk factors include renal impairment, smoking and peripheral vascular disease [ 89 ]. Long term follow up has shown elevated serum platinum levels in TCS for up to 20 years, resulting in neurotoxicity along with ototoxicity, Raynaud’s Phenomenon and cardiovascular disease [ 90 ]. Peripheral as well as autonomic neuropathy are documented as a major factors contributing to higher incidence of unemployment and disability leave in TCS [ 11 ]. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases is found in 1–2% of patients of germ cell cancers [ 91 ]. They are usually treated with combined whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and chemotherapy [ 92 ]. As germ cell tumours can be cured even with brain metastases, long term consequences of WBRT have been widely reported. These include delayed symptoms of seizures, headaches, blindness, dementia and hemiparesis secondary to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. D.M. Doyle et al. followed up 5 patients at 72 months after treatment with WBRT and found CNS gliosis and cerebral atrophy in all of them [ 93 ]."

Risk factors for psychological complications are single status, unemployment, low socioeconomic status, co-morbidities and presence of symptoms or side effects [ 94 ]. A Danish study reported higher levels of stress in TCS (OR 1.56) compared to the general population [ 95 ]. Another study reported a higher incidence of mental health services use in TCS during perioperative period continuing over 12 years of follow up [ 96 ]. Physical activity is found to be beneficial for psychological side effects in TCS, as it reduces the risk [ 97 ]. Registry based studies have reported a higher risk of suicide in TCS (HR 2.5) compared to cancer free population [ 98 ] and even higher risk with cisplatin based chemotherapy treatment [ 99 ]. Of note, suicide risk in TCS increases with follow up time, contrary to the trends of suicide in other cancers which decreases over time [ 100 ]. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide compared to general population stands at 6 within first year, 12 from year 1 to 5 and 17 from year 5 onwards [ 100 ]."

Orchiectomy reduces the quality of semen [ 103 ] and addition of cisplatin based chemotherapies further damage the gonadal function in a dose dependent manner [ 104 ].

        "content": "The interest in survivorship of testicular cancer has grown recently, with many multi-institutional studies highlighting issues experienced by this cohort. This trend in research is possibly due to a rise in incidence, early age of diagnosis and improved cure rates, resulting in a continuously growing population of TCS. Also, this cohort represents the earliest solid organ tumours to be cured and can provide vital insight into survivorship of other cancers. There is plenty of data available to suggest high incidence of comorbidities in TCS and risk factors to develop these complications. Though, platinum based chemotherapy is associated with a high incidence of complications, it is also the main reason for the high cure rates observed. Numerous efforts are going on to reduce the exposure of chemotherapy without making any negative impact on cure rates. Firstly, efforts should be made to avoid chemotherapy or reduce the number of cycles. We can achieve this by using less cycles in good prognostic risk groups and choosing more patients for active surveillance in clinical stage I. It is important to mention here that long term complications after 1 cycle of BEP or carboplatin are not yet investigated. Secondly, studies are investigating the efficacy of primary RPLND in clinical stage IIA and IIB in an attempt to avoid chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But, we have to wait for the results of these studies before making any changes to current practices [ 112 ]. Thirdly, use of more sensitive and specific tumour marker such as miR-371a-3p [ 113 ] will hopefully help with early detection of recurrence and save patients from systemic therapies. Some researchers have pointed out certain genetic variations to identify patients at higher risk of late side effects, but so far genetic testing is not being used in routine practice. Unlike many other cancers, novel agents including targeted therapies and immune check point inhibitors have failed to show any clinical benefit in testicular cancer treatment [ 114 ]. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, cisplatin based chemotherapy will continue to play pivotal role in the treatment of TC. Given this outlook of TCS, there is a pressing need to develop care plans and clinical pathways for unmet needs of these patients. Survivorship clinics should be made a mandatory in all cancer centres and cancer control programs. A holistic approach is needed in survivorship programmes to deal with the physical, psychological as well as social aspects of problems. Cardiometabolic mortality can be reduced by regular screening, treating modifiable risk factors and promoting healthier lifestyles in TCS. Mortality from second malignant neoplasms can also be reduced with targeted screening and surveillance for early detection of cancers. Social issues can be mitigated by treating manageable co-morbidities like Raynaud’s phenomenon, hearing loss, metabolic syndrome, hypogonadism and anxiety. A specialised, purpose-built survivorship clinic can play an important role in improving the mortality and morbidity in TCS. Future research and quality improvement projects should work on these lines to help the TCS cohort."

    "abstract": "Purpose Bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin combination chemotherapy (BEP) improves the survival of patients with testicular cancer, but is associated with potentially life-threatening toxicities like pneumonitis and thromboembolic events. This study explored the effects of physical exercise in patients with testicular cancer during or after BEP-chemotherapy on pulmonary and vascular endothelial toxicity. Methods In this post hoc analysis of a multicenter randomized clinical trial ( NCT01642680 ), patients with metastatic testicular cancer scheduled to receive BEP-chemotherapy were randomized to a 24-week exercise intervention, initiated during (group A) or after BEP-chemotherapy (group B). Endpoints were pulmonary function (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), lung transfer-coefficient and transfer factor for carbon monoxide (KCO, DLCO) and markers of vascular endothelial dysfunction (von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII). Results Thirty patients were included. Post-chemotherapy, patients declined less in FVC, FEV1 and DLCO in group A compared to group B. Post-chemotherapy, vWF and factor VIII were significantly lower in group A compared to group B. After completion of exercise, started either during BEP-chemotherapy or thereafter, no between-group differences were found. At 1-year post-intervention, significant between-group differences were found in favour of group A in DLCO and KCO. Conclusions Patients who exercised during BEP-chemotherapy better preserved FVC, FEV1 and DLCO, measured directly post-chemotherapy and 1-year post-intervention (DLCO, KCO). This coincided with less increase in vWF and factor VIII measured directly post-chemotherapy. These data support a beneficial role of a physical exercise intervention during BEP-chemotherapy on pulmonary and vascular damage in patients with testicular cancer.

        "content": "The introduction of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin combination chemotherapy (BEP) has improved the long-term survival of patients with metastatic testicular cancer to more than 90% (Hanna and Einhorn  2014 ). Unfortunately, BEP chemotherapy is associated with toxicities like bleomycin-induced pneumonitis (BIP), fatal in up to 3% of patients, and thromboembolic events (Watson et al.  2018 ; Sleijfer  2001 ; Haugnes et al.  2015 ). Endothelial damage of the small vessels in the lung plays an important role in the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity (Sleijfer  2001 ). Bleomycin binds to DNA, directly leading to DNA damage and indirectly generating reactive oxygen species (Sleijfer  2001 ; Della Latta et al.  2015 ). The bleomycin hydrolase enzyme degrades bleomycin, but the lungs might be more prone to develop toxicity due to a low concentration of bleomycin hydrolase in pulmonary tissue (Crnovcic et al.  2018 ). Bleomycin activates vascular endothelial cells to secrete inflammatory cytokines and profibrotic mediators like transforming growth factor–β (Liu  2008 ; Leach et al.  2013 ). These mediators stimulate the recruitment and activation of fibroblasts and can lead to lung fibrosis development (Sleijfer  2001 ). In endothelial cells of lung tissue with bleomycin-induced fibrosis, levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) are elevated, both markers of vascular endothelial dysfunction (Marullo et al.  2013 ; Leach et al.  2013 ; Della Latta et al.  2015 ; Kato et al.  2018 ). Vascular endothelial dysfunction is associated with the development of thromboembolic events in patients with testicular cancer, both during and after treatment with bleomycin and cisplatin combination chemotherapy (Nuver et al.  2005 ; Haugnes et al.  2012 ; Lubberts et al.  2016 ; Haugnes et al.  2015 ). Evidence mounts that engaging regularly in moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical exercise is beneficial for vascular endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide availability (Thompson et al.  2003 ; Fiuza-Luces et al.  2018 ; Ignarro  2002 ; Forstermann and Münzel  2006 ; Ozemek et al.  2018 ). Also, physical exercise enhances the production of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidase and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, which counteract oxidative stress (Domenech and Viña  2008 ; Sties et al.  2018 ). Based on these data, we hypothesized that structured physical exercise during BEP-chemotherapy attenuates pulmonary toxicity and vascular endothelial dysfunction in patients with metastatic testicular cancer. This exploratory analysis aimed to investigate the effect of a physical exercise intervention performed during or after BEP-chemotherapy on pulmonary function and markers of vascular endothelial dysfunction, measured before and post-chemotherapy, post-intervention, and 1-year post-intervention."

The supervised exercise consisted of aerobic exercise training thrice a week, resistance exercise training twice a week and optionally once per week leisure sports game activities. The intensity of aerobic exercise training was prescribed based on training heart rate (HR), calculated with the Karvonen formula (training HR = (HR max  – HR rest ) × intensity (%) + HR rest ), using the HR max  and HR rest  from cardiopulmonary exercise testing assessed at baseline (Karvonen and Vuorimaa  1988 ). The intensity increased from 50% (week 1–4), 60% (week 5–6), 70% (week 7–10) and 75% (week 11–12). Initial resistance was fixed on 50% of the 1-repetition maximum during the first week. In the following weeks, resistance increased by 5–10%. During the home-based program, patients were asked to continue aerobic exercise training by walking, running or cycling and to fill out a training log for adherence to the prescribed exercise. Additional information about the training schedule, including an exemplar exercise schedule can be found in the Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 1). Patients visited the outpatient clinic before the start of chemotherapy, directly post-chemotherapy, post-intervention and 1-year post-intervention (Fig.  1 ). Patient characteristics were obtained from medical records: tumour characteristics, chemotherapy dosages, medical history, medication and cardiovascular risk factors. Also, data on BIP risk factors (age at onset of chemotherapy, cumulative dose of bleomycin, pulmonary metastases, smoking status and renal function (glomerular filtration rate using the Cockroft Gault formula) were collected from medical records. Adherence to the exercise intervention was defined as the number of attended physical exercise sessions divided by the number of prescribed exercise sessions. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were monitored until the final measurement at 1-year post-intervention. Data on bleomycin pulmonary toxicity were recorded using the following classification (Nuver et al.  2005 ): (a) death due to BIP, (b) clinical or radiographic signs of BIP resulting in hospitalization, premature cessation of bleomycin administration, use of steroids, (c) clinical or radiographic signs of BIP after completion of treatment, use of steroids, (d) no signs of BIP. Pulmonary function was assessed by use of dynamic spirometry (Masterscreen PFT-PRO, CareFusion). It included the parameters forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and the FEV1/FVC ratio. The lung transfer-coefficient for carbon monoxide (KCO) and transfer factor for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were corrected for hemoglobin. Pulmonary function parameters were expressed as raw values (in figures) and as a percentage of predicted normal values (in tables). Fasting blood samples were analysed for vWF, factor VIII, fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and PAI-1. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse patient characteristics. Intention-to-treat linear mixed model analyses were performed for within-group and between-group differences at three timepoints—directly post-chemotherapy, post-intervention and 1-year post-intervention and were adjusted for baseline values. We calculated the standardized effect size (ES) by dividing the adjusted between-group mean difference of the measurement directly post-chemotherapy, post-intervention and 1-year post-intervention using the pooled T0 standard deviation. An ES < 0.2 was considered ‘no difference’, ES between 0.2 and 0.5 small difference, ES between 0.5 and 0.8 moderate difference and ES > 0.8 substantial difference (Cohen  1988 ). A 95% confidence interval (CI) not including 0 indicates significance at a  P  level of < 0.05."

From five patients who did not perform the exercise in the hospital but at a local physiotherapy practice, the exact data on adherence were missing. The training log for the subsequent home-based unsupervised exercise was filled out by 14 of 29 patients. In group A, adherence to the home-based exercise was 77.8% (range 41.7–125.0%); in group B, adherence was 72.2% (range 5.6–138.9%),  P  = 0.947. In total, 3 out of 30 patients (10.0%), all in group A compared to none in group B, developed signs of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity ( P  = 0.224). Of these patients, two were previous smokers and one patient had never smoked. One patient developed clinical and radiographic signs of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity during BEP chemotherapy, resulting in discontinuing bleomycin administration (after receiving 210 United States Pharmacopeia (USP)). One patient developed clinical signs of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity during chemotherapy and radiographic signs after completion of chemotherapy (after receiving 270 USP, no dose reduction). One patient developed clinical and radiographic signs of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity after completion of chemotherapy (cumulative bleomycin dose: 270 USP). Regarding occurrence of vascular events, none of the patients in group A developed a vascular event. Of the patients in group B, 2 out of 15 patients developed a vascular event (13.3%,  P  = 0.343). Of these patients, one developed pulmonary embolisms and one patient developed thrombosis of the basilar and ulnar veins, both occurred after completion of the second course of BEP chemotherapy. No exercise-related (serious) adverse events occurred. One patient in group B developed pulmonary embolisms during chemotherapy. One patient in group A was hospitalized due to a Mycoplasma Pneumonia infection after completion of chemotherapy. One patient in group A had melena during chemotherapy, for which no cause was found with gastroduodenoscopy. One patient in group B withdrew his consent during chemotherapy, because he thought that participating in the exercise intervention after completion of chemotherapy would be too time consuming. Results of pulmonary function parameters are shown in Tables  2  and  3  and Fig.  3 . Directly post-chemotherapy, exercise has led to significantly less decline in FVC%predicted and DLCO%predicted (mean between-group A and B difference 4.4, 95% CI 0.5–8.4, ES: 0.38,  P  = 0.029 and 5.7, 95% CI 0.9–10.4, ES: 0.54,  P  = 0.020, respectively). Comparable, but non-significant effects were found for FEV1%predicted and KCO%predicted (4.2, 95% CI – 0.3 to 8.7, ES: 0.37,  P  = 0.067, and 3.7 95% CI – 0.7 to 8.2, ES: 0.24,  P  = 0.099, respectively). The between-group difference of FEV1 (raw data) measured post-chemotherapy was statistically significant in favour of group A (0.22, 95% CI 0.0–0.4, p = 0.047, Fig.  3 ). After both groups had completed 24 weeks of exercise, no statistically significant differences were observed in the pulmonary function parameters between group A and B. At 1-year post-intervention, significantly smaller declines in KCO%predicted and DLCO%predicted were found in group A compared to group B (6.7, 95% CI 2.2–11.2, ES: 0.43,  P  = 0.004 and 5.4, 95% CI 0.7–10.2, ES: 0.52,  P  = 0.026, respectively).

We found statistically significant differences between groups for FVC, FEV1, DLCO, KCO, vWF and factor VIII, measured directly post-chemotherapy in favour of the group that exercised during chemotherapy (group A). Also, 1-year post-intervention, significant differences were found in pulmonary function (KCO, DLCO) in favour of group A. Physical exercise may reduce the BEP-induced generation of reactive oxygen species and thereby prevent the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction and the consequent inflammatory response (Simioni et al.  2018 ). In pulmonary tissue, this could manifest in better preservation of the permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane (Plantier et al.  2018 ). This might explain the limited decline of DLCO in patients who attended the physical exercise intervention during chemotherapy in our study. Another explanation for the difference in DLCO between the groups could be that the respiratory muscle weakness due to chemotherapy, use of corticosteroids and immobility during hospitalization in group B was more profound, leading to submaximal inspiratory volumes and functional alveolar volumes (Graham et al.  2017 ). Since DLCO is the product of KCO and alveolar volume, a fall in alveolar volume may subsequently lead to a decrease in DLCO (Graham et al.  2017 ). However, a reduction in DLCO due to inspiratory muscle weakness is typically accompanied by a compensatory increase in KCO (Hughes and Pride  2001 ; Hart et al.  2002 ). We did not observe an increase in KCO, suggesting that the underlying cause of the difference in DLCO between both groups is more likely a difference in permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane. We also found that FEV1 and FVC were better preserved during chemotherapy in group A compared to group B. The physical exercise intervention during BEP-chemotherapy may maintain physical fitness and respiratory muscle strength and thereby possibly preserved values of FEV1 and FVC (Kenn et al.  2013 ; Vainshelboim et al.  2014 ). Regarding the effect of exercise on pulmonary function, as measured by FVC and FEV1, the results should be interpreted cautiously because of our small patient group and because of the study of Lauritsen et al. ( 2016 ), who did not detect any difference in FVC and FEV1 pre- to post BEP-chemotherapy among 550 patients with testicular cancer. Additionally, the absolute difference in pulmonary volumes in our study is small (post-chemotherapy FVC: 4.4%, FEV1 4.2%) and clinical relevance is questionable. Regarding DLCO, the study of Lauritsen et al. did find a statistically significant decline post BEP-chemotherapy compared to pre BEP-chemotherapy (11.1%,  P  < 0.001). Five years after completion of chemotherapy, the DLCO had returned to baseline values in these patients: diffusion capacity abnormality was detected in 15.6% (95% CI 11.3–19.9%) at 5 years follow-up compared with 20.7% pretreatment (95% CI 16.6–24.8%). Also, Lauritsen et al. found that after a median follow-up of 16.1 years, the 15-year cumulative risk of pulmonary diseases in patients treated with BEP-chemotherapy was comparable to that of patients with stage 1 testicular cancer who were observed on a surveillance program. Unfortunately, no data is shown about the level of physical activity during and after treatment with BEP-chemotherapy. In our study, patients in group A (exercise during BEP-chemotherapy) declined by 11.2% and patients in group B (exercise after BEP-chemotherapy) declined by 16.1%, with a statistically significant within-group difference of 5.7 (95% confidence interval 0.9–10.4, with a moderate effect size of 0.54). However, the study of Shamash et al. ( 2017 ) only showed a weak correlation between the decline in DLCO and pulmonary toxicity on a chest CT-scans. Therefore, DLCO may not be used as marker for pulmonary toxicity and it is questionable whether a decrease in DLCO should be used in the clinic to discontinue bleomycin). However, DLCO may be considered as marker for vascular endothelial dysfunction. A recent study investigating vascular endothelial function and pulmonary function in patients with type 2 diabetes, found a strong correlation between DLCO and vascular endothelial function parameters (nitric oxide,  r  = 0.797, endothelin-1,  r  = – 0.787 and flow mediated dilatation,  r  = 0.700) (3). In multiple regression analysis, DLCO remained significantly correlated with flow mediated dilatation, which is a well-known marker for endothelial function (Tai et al.  2021 ). The reduced decline in DLCO in patients who exercised during BEP-chemotherapy, combined with less increase in factor VIII and vWF in these patients, could be considered as a hypothesis-generating result, since all three markers are suggestive for vascular endothelial damage. Results of the present study suggest that attending physical exercise during BEP-chemotherapy might protect against vascular endothelial dysfunction. Currently, limited data are available on effects of exercise on vascular endothelial dysfunction. A retrospective study in elderly male volunteers showed a significant inverse dose–response relationship between physical exercise and fibrinogen levels, factor VIII, vWF, t-Pa and PAI-1 (Wannamethee et al.  2002 ). A recent meta-analysis including four randomized controlled trials, indicated that exercise training improves vascular endothelial function in breast and prostate cancer survivors, measured with flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery or the reactive hyperemia index (Beaudry et al.  2018 ). Exercise increased the flow-mediated dilatation with 1.3%, as compared to non-exercise. Importantly, a 1% increase in flow-mediated dilatation is associated with a reduction of 8–13% of future cardiovascular events (Beaudry et al.  2018 ). Lubberts et al. found that vWF and factor VIII significantly increased in patients with metastatic testicular cancer during (B)EP-chemotherapy without participation in an exercise intervention, which lasted up to 1-year post-chemotherapy ( 2016 ). The increase in factor VIII and vWF during chemotherapy was comparable to the outcome of our study in group B. However, this increase was less profound in patients who started the supervised exercise intervention during BEP-chemotherapy. In total, 3 out of 30 patients (10.0%, non-significant), all in group A, developed signs of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity. Two out of 30 patients (13.3%, non-significant), all in group B, developed a vascular event. However, the small numbers make it difficult to draw conclusions about the clinical significance and importance of this finding. Future studies including larger patient cohorts attending physical exercise during and after BEP-chemotherapy, should monitor the occurrence of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity and occurrence of vascular events. No adverse events related to the exercise intervention occurred in our study. In a study in which patients with testicular cancer were randomized to supervised high-intensity interval training (HIIT, 85–95% of HR peak ) during (B)EP-chemotherapy or a usual care group, three of the first nine patients randomized to HIIT developed severe thromboembolic events during the intervention (Thorsen et al.  2020 ). Possibly, HIIT increased vascular shear stress and causes relative dehydration, inducing an increase in blood viscosity (Wolberg et al.  2012 ). Since these are risk factors for developing thromboembolic events, HIIT might have played a role in developing thromboembolic events. In contrast, our study’s supervised physical exercise intervention comprised a tailored continuous endurance training with moderate-to-vigorous intensity and strength training, gradually increasing in intensity over the weeks. Results of another study that investigated HITT in patients with testicular cancer after completing their treatment suggest that HITT is safe and feasible after treatment (Adams et al.  2017 ). Comparison of the effects of exercise on treatment-related morbidity to a control group would have been very interesting. However, when the study protocol of the ACT-trial was written (2012), it was already known that physical exercise during and after treatment with chemotherapy has evident beneficial effects on various chemotherapy-related adverse effects, and that physical training was beneficial on several outcomes such as physical fitness, muscle strength, fatigue, and quality of life. In addition, exercise programs appeared to be safe. However, knowledge of the timing of the physical exercise training was lacking and therefore, the topic of this study was randomizing exercise during versus after chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing beneficial effects of physical exercise during BEP-chemotherapy on pulmonary function parameters and markers of vascular endothelial activation in patients with testicular cancer. The study had several strengths and limitations. Strengths are the randomized design and the high adherence rate to the physical exercise intervention. Limitations are the small patient groups and the lack of importance of DLCO in predicting bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity (Watson et al.  2018 ; Sleijfer  2001 ). However, DLCO may be used as marker of vascular endothelial dysfunction (Tai et al.  2021 ). Despite the limitations described above, the suggestion of a protective effect of a physical exercise intervention during BEP-chemotherapy on vascular endothelial function, warrants further research in larger patient groups with longer follow-up .  For example, future studies investigating the effects of exercise during and after chemotherapy should investigate the occurrence of e.g. cardiovascular events and other cardiovascular related late effects in the longer term."

        "content": "In this explorative analysis, patients who started the exercise intervention during BEP-chemotherapy better preserved their pulmonary function (DLCO, FVC), measured directly post-chemotherapy and 1-year post-intervention (DLCO, KCO). This coincided with less increase in factor VIII and vWF, measured directly post-chemotherapy. These data support a beneficial role of a physical exercise intervention during BEP-chemotherapy on pulmonary and vascular toxicity in patients with testicular cancer and warrant further investigation. Three patients in group A developed BIP, compared to none in group B. Two patients in group B developed a vascular event, compared to none in group A. The small numbers of patients with BIP and vascular events warrant caution when interpreting these data."

    "title": "Reciprocal epigenetic remodeling controls testicular cancer hypersensitivity to hypomethylating agents and chemotherapy",
    "abstract": "Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are aggressive but sensitive to cisplatin‐based chemotherapy. Alternative therapies are needed for tumors refractory to cisplatin with hypomethylating agents providing one possibility. The mechanisms of cisplatin hypersensitivity and resistance in TGCTs remain poorly understood. Recently, it has been shown that TGCTs, even those resistant to cisplatin, are hypersensitive to very low doses of hypomethylating agents including 5‐aza deoxy‐cytosine (5‐aza) and guadecitabine. We undertook a pharmacogenomic approach in order to better understand mechanisms of TGCT hypomethylating agent hypersensitivity by generating a panel of acquired 5‐aza‐resistant TGCT cells and contrasting these to previously generated acquired isogenic cisplatin‐resistant cells from the same parent. Interestingly, there was a reciprocal relationship between cisplatin and 5‐aza sensitivity, with cisplatin resistance associated with increased sensitivity to 5‐aza and 5‐aza resistance associated with increased sensitivity to cisplatin. Unbiased transcriptome analysis revealed 5‐aza‐resistant cells strongly downregulated polycomb target gene expression, the exact opposite of the finding for cisplatin‐resistant cells, which upregulated polycomb target genes. This was associated with a dramatic increase in H3K27me3 and decrease in DNMT3B levels in 5‐aza‐resistant cells, the exact opposite changes seen in cisplatin‐resistant cells. Evidence is presented that reciprocal regulation of polycomb and DNMT3B may be initiated by changes in DNMT3B levels as DNMT3B knockdown alone in parental cells resulted in increased expression of H3K27me3, EZH2, and BMI1, conferred 5‐aza resistance and cisplatin sensitization, and mediated genome‐wide repression of polycomb target gene expression. Finally, genome‐wide analysis revealed that 5‐aza‐resistant, cisplatin‐resistant, and DNMT3B‐knockdown cells alter the expression of a common set of polycomb target genes. This study highlights that reciprocal epigenetic changes mediated by DNMT3B and polycomb may be a key driver of the unique cisplatin and 5‐aza hypersensitivity of TGCTs and suggests that distinct epigenetic vulnerabilities may exist for pharmacological targeting of TGCTs.",

        "content": "Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common solid tumor of males 15–40 years of age [ 1 ]. Prior to the introduction of cisplatin‐based chemotherapy, the majority of metastatic TGCT patients died of progressive disease. This situation has been remarkably reversed with cisplatin‐based therapy where nearly 80% of metastatic patients survive beyond 5 years [ 2 ]. A greater understanding of the curability of TGCTs may inform more effective strategies to treat other metastatic cancers. Also, cisplatin refractory patients have a poor prognosis and 50% will die of progressive disease [ 3 ]. There are essentially no effective traditional, targeted, or immunotherapies for these patients. We and others have shown in preclinical models that TGCT cells are hypersensitive to hypomethylating agents including 5‐aza deoxycytidine (5‐aza) and the 5‐aza prodrug, guadecitabine [ 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ]. This hypersensitivity is on the order of 100‐ to 1000‐fold compared to the sensitivity of other solid cancers, extends to cisplatin‐resistant TGCT cells, and depends on very high levels of the DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3B. These findings are in line with the hypothesis that due to their germ cell origins and low mutational burden, TGCTs may be especially driven and sustained by distinct epigenetic alterations resulting in distinct vulnerabilities to epigenetic drugs [ 9 ,  10 ,  11 ]. Importantly, hypomethylating agents have been shown to resensitize cisplatin‐resistant cells to cisplatin and we and a second group have provided early phase clinical findings suggesting that a subset of cisplatin refractory TGCT patients favorably respond to guadecitabine in combination with cisplatin [ 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ]. However, besides the potential role of DNMT3B, the mechanisms accounting for the hypersensitivity of TGCT cells to hypomethylating agents are unknown. In prior work, we developed a series of isogenic cisplatin refractory cell lines from parental cisplatin sensitive cells following a protocol designed to mimic cisplatin‐based patient therapy [ 15 ]. Genome‐wide transcriptome analysis revealed that the majority of cisplatin‐resistant cells gained expression of genes normally repressed by the polycomb pathway, which coincided with a global decrease in H3K27me3, H2AUbK119, and decreased expression of the polycomb pathway components EZH2 and/or BMI1 [ 15 ]. Further, pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 conferred cisplatin resistance to TGCT cells, while inhibition of H3K27me3 demethylases sensitized TGCT cells to cisplatin [ 15 ]. This implies that targeting the polycomb pathway may have therapeutic value in treating cisplatin‐resistant TGCTs. We also reported that these cisplatin‐resistant cells have global and genome‐wide DNA hypermethylation compared to parental, cisplatin‐sensitive cells [ 16 ]. The association between genome‐wide DNA hypermethylation and cisplatin resistance has also recently been demonstrated in TGCT patients [ 17 ]. Our cisplatin‐resistant cells also possessed hypomethylation at polycomb target gene promoters, suggesting a complex crosstalk exists between the polycomb and DNA methylation pathways that influences cisplatin sensitivity of TGCT cells [ 16 ]. The current study directly addresses mechanisms of TGCT hypersensitivity to DNA hypomethylating agents through the derivation of unique isogenic 5‐aza‐resistant cells models. Interestingly, transcriptome analysis strongly suggests that the polycomb pathway is also altered in 5‐aza‐resistant cells but in a manner opposite to that of isogenic cisplatin‐resistant cells, whereby 5‐aza resistance is associated with a dramatic downregulation of polycomb target gene expression. This reciprocal relationship was also evident for H3K27me3 and DNMT3B with 5‐aza resistance associated with a dramatic downregulation of DNMT3B and upregulation of H3K27me3, the exact opposite situation noted in isogenic cisplatin‐resistant cells. Further, 5‐aza‐resistant cells were more sensitive to cisplatin, while cisplatin‐resistant cells were more sensitive to 5‐aza. Finally, we provide evidence that DNMT3B may be an important upstream driver of epigenetic crosstalk in TGCT cells since DNMT3B depletion alone upregulated the polycomb pathway and conferred resistance to 5‐aza and increased sensitivity to cisplatin. These data suggest that epigenetic remodeling mediated by polycomb and DNMT3B are major drivers of the unique pharmacology of TGCTs that includes hypersensitivity to cisplatin and hypomethylating agents."

The 2102EP cells are a human testicular cancer‐derived embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and authenticated by ATCC with karyotyping and short tandem repeat profiling. Cells were frozen within 1 month of purchase and used within 2 months of resuscitation. Generation of 5‐aza resistant cell lines was similar to our previously reported generation of cisplatin‐resistant cells [ 15 ]. Parental cells were exposed to stepwise dosages of 5‐aza deoxycytidine (Sigma; St. Louis, MO, USA) starting at 1.0 n m  for three consecutive days and then allowed to recover for 1–2 weeks (Fig.  1A ). This cycle was repeated 4–6 times with a final selection at 100 n m  5‐aza. Clones were then derived from each pool with cloning cylinders. Cells with prefix AH1, AH2A, and AH2B were cloned from independently treated batches of cells. All clones were stably resistant since resistance to 5‐aza was retained after passaging in 5‐aza‐free media for at least 4 months. Stable cisplatin‐resistant cells 2102EP‐B3, 2102EP‐C1, and 2102EP‐C4 were previously described [ 15 ].

(E) Cisplatin‐resistant cell lines 2102EP‐B3, 2102EP‐C1, and 2102EP‐C4 have increased sensitivity to 5‐aza compared to parental cells.

(F) 5‐aza‐resistant cell lines 2102EP‐AH2A5, 2102EPAH2‐B9, and 2102EP‐AH2A2 have increased sensitivity to cisplatin compared to parental cells.

(I) 5‐aza‐resistant and cisplatin‐resistant 2102EP cells have similar basal doubling times compared to parental cells. All data represent mean ± standard error of the mean of four biological determinations. Two‐tailed Student's  t ‐tests were performed for statistical analysis. * P  ≤ 0.05, ** P  ≤ 0.01, *** P  ≤ 0.005, **** P  ≤ 0.001 compared to parental cells. All experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results. Cells were treated with the indicated dosages of 5‐aza for three consecutive days and cells assayed for survival 1 day after the last dose (Fig.  1B ). Cells were treated with cisplatin for 6 h and cells assayed for survival 3 days later (Fig.  1B ). To assess cell viability, CellTiter‐Glo (Promega; Madison, WI, USA) assays were performed as previously described [ 15 ]. For each cell line, four biological replicates were tested at each concentration, and experiments were repeated at least twice on different days. IC50 values were estimated from the best‐fit dose–response model selected by residual standard error using  graphpad prism  software (San Diego, CA, USA). To estimate cell doubling times, equal number of cells were plated in 24‐well plates and viable cell numbers determined for four consecutive days using the CellTiter‐Glo assay. Doubling times were calculated with an exponential growth curve equation using  graphpad prism  software. Lentiviruses were produced by co‐transfecting HEK293 cells with 10 μg of the viral packaging vector pCMV‐dR8.2 and envelope vector pCMV‐VSV‐G (10 : 1 ratio) and 10 μg of lenti‐shRNA or the control vector using Lipofectamine 3000. Lentiviral silencing shRNA targeting DNMT3B (TRCN0000437183, TRCN0000414235, TRCN0000378379, TRCN0000364153, and TRCN0000364152) was purchased from Sigma along with TRC lentiviral nontargeting shRNA control (SHC016). The HEK293 cell medium was changed 24 h after transfection, and cells were incubated for 48 h to allow for virus production. After 48 h, HEK293 medium containing viral particles was filtered and transferred onto 2102EP cells for 48 h. After transduction, cells were selected with 2 μg·mL −1  puromycin. RNA was extracted from indicated parental, 5‐aza‐resistant, DNMT3Bsh1‐knockdown, and shPLK0.1 control cells in biological triplicate using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen; Germantown, MD, USA). RNA sequencing was performed by the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center. RNA‐Seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep kit as previously described. The libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 using HiSeq 4000 sequencing kit version 1. Initial quality control was performed using  fastqc . Trimmomatic was used to remove low‐quality bases from both ends LEADING ≤ 28 and TRAILING ≤ 28, respectively, with minimum length of 30. The reads in  fastq  format were aligned to human genome assembly NCBI GRCh38.p13 using  star  aligner as previously described [ 15 ]. Reads were counted and assigned to genes using featureCount. The  limma r  package was used to identify differentially expressed genes [ 18 ]. Genes whose expression was not greater than 0.5 counts per million in at least two samples were removed, and the resultant filtered expression matrix was TMM‐normalized. Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple hypotheses. Genes with FDR ≤ 0.01 and absolute fold change ≥ 1.5 were considered differentially expressed. In all cases, each 5‐aza‐resistant cell line was compared to the parental line. The ‘ enhanced volcano ’  r  package was used for visualization of volcano plots. RNA‐seq data for 2102EP‐C1 cells were from our prior study [ 15 ]. The RNA‐seq datasets for the current study have been submitted to the NCBI Database of GEO Datasets under the accession numbers  GSE172266  and  GSE172458 . Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) from the Broad Institute was performed to identify enriched gene sets in each resistant cell line compared to parental cells [ 19 ]. The BART (Binding Analysis for Regulation of Transcription) tool in gene‐set mode was used to predict the enrichment of transcription factor binding sites in differentially expressed genes [ 20 ].  geneoverlap  package from  r bioconductor  was used to identify significant gene set overlap between common gene expression changes between 2102EP‐AH2A2, 2102EP‐C1, and 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells and C2 gene sets from the MSigDB database [ 19 ,  21 ]. For western analysis, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer and separated by SDS/PAGE. Antibodies to actin (MA1‐744; Thermo Fisher; Waltham, MA, USA), ubiquitin H2A‐K119 (3240; Cell Signaling Technology; Danvers, MA, USA), H3K27me3 (9733; Cell Signaling Technology), BMI1 (6964; Cell Signaling Technology), EZH2 (5246; Cell Signaling Technology), DNMT3B (ab2851; Abcam; Cambridge, UK), and DNMT1 (SC‐20701; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Dallas, TX, USA) were used. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and complementary DNAs were synthesized using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio‐Rad Laboratories; Hercules, CA, USA). Quantitative real‐time PCR assays were performed with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio‐Rad Laboratories) and the QuantStudio 3 Real‐time System (Thermo Fisher). In all cases, gene expression was normalized to β‐actin. Primers for RT‐PCR are provided in Table  S1 . Two‐tailed Student's  t ‐tests were performed where appropriate using  graphpad prism  v6.0, and  P ‐values indicative of nonsignificant  P  > 0.05 and significant * P  ≤ 0.05 were determined. Mean and standard error of the mean was used to describe sample variability."

For each cell line, four biological replicates were tested at each concentration, and experiments were repeated at least twice on different days. IC50 values were estimated from the best‐fit dose–response model selected by residual standard error using  graphpad prism  software (San Diego, CA, USA). To estimate cell doubling times, equal number of cells were plated in 24‐well plates and viable cell numbers determined for four consecutive days using the CellTiter‐Glo assay. Doubling times were calculated with an exponential growth curve equation using  graphpad prism  software."

        "content": "We and others have previously documented that TGCT‐derived EC cells undergo an acute cytotoxic response to low nanomolar levels of hypomethylating agents including 5‐aza and guadecitabine [ 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ]. Anticancer effects for most somatic cancer cells require doses of hypomethylating agents 100‐ to 1000‐fold higher and the effects at these higher doses manifest as delayed antiproliferative responses rather than acute cytotoxic responses [ 22 ]. In order to better understand the mechanism of hypomethylating agent hypersensitivity of EC, we developed a panel of distinct clonal 5‐aza‐resistant cell lines from parental 2102EP cells. 2102EP cells were chosen as it was difficult to generate 5‐aza‐resistant cells in other parental TGCT lines, including NT2/D1 and 833K without inducing differentiation. Cells were treated with increasing dosages of 5‐aza starting at 1 n m  for three consecutive days and allowed to recover for 1–2 weeks. Final selection was at 100 n m  5‐aza, and cells were then cloned (Fig.  1A ). Cells with prefix designation AH1, AH2A, and AH2B were cloned from independently treated batches of cells. Resistance to 5‐aza was confirmed in dose response experiments with 3 day 5‐aza treatments (Fig.  1B,C ). The 5‐aza IC50s of resistant cells ranged from 35 to 100 n m  compared to the 10 n m  IC50 of parental cells (Fig.  1D ). Resistance was maintained for at least 4 months of cell passage in 5‐aza free media. In a prior report, we noted that one of the most 5‐aza‐sensitive EC cell lines was the cisplatin resistant EC line 833K‐CP [ 6 ]. This prompted us to compare and contrast 5‐aza and cisplatin sensitivity in the newly generated 5‐aza‐resistant 2102EP cells with our previously derived isogenic cisplatin‐resistant 2102EP cells [ 15 ]. We focused our studies on three 5‐aza‐resistant lines (2102EP‐AH2A2, 21012EP‐AH2B9, and 2102EP‐AH1A5) and three cisplatin‐resistant lines (2102EP‐B3, 2102EP‐C1, and 2102EP‐C4) [ 15 ]. All three cisplatin‐resistant cell derivatives demonstrated increased sensitivity to 5‐aza compared to parental 2102EP, while all three 5‐aza‐resistant cells lines demonstrated either increased sensitivity to cisplatin or a trend toward increased sensitivity to cisplatin (Fig.  1E–H ). This was despite the fact the all six cell lines had comparable levels of basal cell proliferation when drug was not present as compared to parental cells, indicating that differences in drug sensitivity was not due to gross alterations in cell proliferation (Fig.  1I ). In order to understand mechanisms of 5‐aza resistance, RNA‐seq analysis was performed in biological triplicate in 2102EP parental and 2102EP‐AH1A5, 2102EP‐AH2B9, and 2102EP‐AH2A2 cells. There was a substantial number of differentially expressed genes with a fold‐change of 1.5 and FDR ≤ 0.01 in 5‐aza‐resistant cells as compared to parental 2102EP cells (Fig.  2A ). For AH1A2 and AH2B9 cells, there were 2091 and 2264 genes downregulated, respectively, compared to parental cells and 1754 and 2351 genes upregulated, respectively. In AH1A5 cells, there was substantially more genes downregulated than upregulated compared to parental cells at this cutoff, 2052 vs 544 genes, respectively. The identity of these differentially expressed genes is provided in Table  S2 . 5‐aza resistance in testicular cancer cells is associated with decreased expression of polycomb target genes. (A) Volcano plots indicating the number of significantly upregulated (blue) and downregulated (red) genes in 5‐aza‐resistant 2102EP‐AHA2A, 2102EP‐AH2B9, and 2102EP‐AH1A5 cells compared to parental 2102EP cells. Number of genes upregulated and downregulated with a 1.5‐fold cutoff and FDR ≤ 0.01 for each resistant line is indicated. Volcano plots are based on RNA‐seq analysis from biological triplicates. (B) Downregulated genes from 5‐aza‐resistant cells are enriched for gene sets associated with H3K27 methylation and PRC2 targets. GSEA indicating all polycomb‐related negatively enriched gene sets within the top 50 ranked by NES from 5529 curated gene gets from the MSigDB C2 collection in 5‐aza‐resistant cells compared to respective parental cells. (C) Representative gene set enrichment plots. NES, normalized enrichment score. We next performed unbiased GSEA comparing each aza‐resistant cell line with parental 2102EP cells. The top 50 positively and negatively enriched gene sets (from over 5529 curated gene sets) for each cell line ranked by normalized enrichment score is provided in Table  S3 . Interestingly for genes downregulated in the 5‐aza‐resistant cells, there was a highly significant enrichment for multiple gene sets related to polycomb target genes (Fig.  2B ). For example, of the top 50 ranked gene sets for downregulated genes, 13, 13, and 10 independent gene sets related to polycomb target genes were noted for AH2A2, AH2B9 and AH1A5 cells, respectively (Fig.  2B,C ). This was by far the most frequent and significant gene set family that emerged from GSEA, suggesting that the 5‐aza‐resistant cells have globally downregulated expression of polycomb target genes. Interestingly, we identified previously in 10 isogenic cisplatin‐resistant EC cells including those derived from parental 2102EP, the exact opposite pattern of polycomb gene expression with polycomb target genes being among the most significantly upregulated gene sets [ 15 ]. BART (binding analysis for regulation of transcription) predicts functional transcription factor binding based on more than 6000 ChIP‐seq datasets for over 400 factors in human and mouse cells [ 20 ]. The BART analysis of genes downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells, as compared with parental controls, strongly predicted polycomb complex component binding. The number of distinct PRC1/PRC2‐related components contained in the top 20 predicted transcription factor binders for each line ranged from three to five and included EZH2, JARID2, SUZ12, and EED (Table  S4 ). These results further suggest the polycomb pathway is a major mediator in regulating downregulated genes in the 5‐aza‐resistant cells. In contrast, BART analysis of cisplatin‐resistant cells demonstrated polycomb component binding enrichment in upregulated genes [ 15 ]. To further probe the reciprocal nature of 5‐aza‐ and cisplatin‐resistant cells, immunoblot and RT‐PCR analyses were performed. We focused on the three 5‐aza‐ and three cisplatin‐resistant 2102EP lines used for current and prior RNA‐seq analysis (Fig.  2A ) [ 15 ]. Remarkably, all three 5‐aza‐resistant 2102EP cell lines had a dramatic increase in the polycomb marks H3K27me3 and H2AUbK119 compared to parental cells, while, as previously shown, the cisplatin‐resistant cells had decreased expression of these marks (Fig.  3A ) [ 15 ]. DNMT3B levels were also assessed, since we have previously shown that hypersensitivity of EC cells to 5‐aza is dependent on high‐level expression of DNMT3B [ 5 ,  6 ]. Interestingly, all three 5‐aza‐resistant cells had dramatically decreased expression of DNMT3B, while all three cisplatin‐resistant cells had a dramatic increase in DNMT3B expression compared to parental cells (Fig.  3A ). In contrast, there was minimal change in DNMT1 expression among the cell lines. 5‐aza‐resistant and cisplatin‐resistant testicular cancer cells have reciprocally altered levels of H3K27me3 and DNMT3B. (A) Immunoblot analysis of indicated cell lines (2102EP parent is loaded twice) with antibodies recognizing DNMT3B, DNMT1, H3K27me3, H2AUbK119, and actin. (B–D) Real‐time PCR analysis of mRNA expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, BMI1, EZH2, KDM6A, and KDM6B. Data are the mean of triplicate determinations, and error bars are standard error of the mean. Two‐tailed Student's  t ‐tests were performed for statistical analysis. * P  ≤ 0.05, ** P  ≤ 0.01, *** P  ≤ 0.005, **** P  ≤ 0.001. Each experiment was repeated at least twice with similar results. Real‐time PCR analysis demonstrated substantial downregulated expression of DNMT3B in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and a dramatic upregulated expression of DNMT3B in cisplatin‐resistant cells, consistent with immunoblot analysis and suggesting regulation of DNMT3B in these cell models is at the level of mRNA regulation (Fig.  3B ). In contrast, there were only small changes in mRNA for DNMT1 and DNMT3A between the cell lines. PRC1 component BMI1 was upregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells while downregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells consistent with the changes observed in H2AUbK119 (Fig.  3C ). Expression of EZH2 also followed this same general trend but was less consistently changed between the resistant cells (Fig.  3C ). The H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6B was upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells consistent with the downregulation of H3K27me3 in cisplatin‐resistant cells, but unchanged in the 5‐aza‐resistant cell lines (Fig.  3D ). In contrast, expression of the H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6A was relatively unchanged between the lines (Fig.  3D ). These data suggest that the reciprocal alterations seen in H3K27me3 and H2AUbK119 could be related to changes in expression of certain polycomb components. Our prior work suggested a role for global remodeling of DNA methylation in the upregulation of polycomb target gene expression in cisplatin‐resistant TGCT cells [ 16 ]. To investigate whether changes in DNMT3B play a causal role in altering polycomb signaling and 5‐aza and cisplatin sensitivity in TGCT cells, DNMT3B was targeted by shRNA in parental 2102EP cells (Fig.  4A,B ). Note that in some experiments shRNA1 only mediated a partial knockdown of DNMT3B. However, DNMT3B knockdown was stable and persisted for extended cell culture intervals up to several months. DNMT3B shRNA resulted in upregulation of H3K27me3 levels and BMI1 and EZH2 protein expression in 2102EP cells (Fig.  4B ). BMI1 induction was also noted at the mRNA level where little change was noted in mRNA levels of EZH2, KDM6A, and KDM6B upon DNMT3B knockdown (Fig.  4C ). DNMT3B shRNA did not affect levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3A (Fig.  4C ). Notably, DNMT3B shRNA also resulted in resistance to 5‐aza, as we have shown previously [ 5 ,  6 ], but importantly these cells also demonstrated a sensitization to cisplatin (Fig.  4D ). These results suggest that repression of DNMT3B expression alone is sufficient to induce H3K27me3 levels in TGCT cells and that knockdown of DNMT3B mimics the situation seen in 5‐aza‐resistant cells, namely, 5‐aza resistance and heightened cisplatin sensitivity. The results suggest that alterations in DNMT3B may be driving the crosstalk between DNA methylation and polycomb signaling noted in cisplatin‐resistant and 5‐aza‐resistant TGCT cells. DNMT3B‐knockdown results in induction of H3K27me3, BMI1 and EZH2, and confers 5‐aza resistance and cisplatin sensitization to TGCT cells. (A) Real‐time PCR and immunoblot confirmation of stable shRNA knockdown of DNMT3B in 2102EP cells. (B) Knockdown of DNMT3B in 2102EP cells results in increased protein levels of BMI1, EZH2, and H3K27me3. (C) Real‐time PCR indicates an induction of BMI1 mRNA after DNMT3B knockdown in 2102EP cells. Data are the mean of triplicate determinations, and error bars are standard error of the mean. (D) DNMT3B knockdown in 2102EP cells confers 5‐aza sensitivity and cisplatin sensitization. Data represent mean ± standard error of the mean of four biological determinations. Two‐tailed Student's  t ‐tests were performed for statistical analysis. * P  ≤ 0.05, **** P  ≤ 0.001. Each experiment was repeated at least twice with similar results. Our findings suggest a reciprocal regulation of polycomb signaling in cisplatin‐resistant and 5‐aza‐resistant cells. Since 5‐aza resistance could be phenocopied by DNMT3B silencing alone, RNA‐seq analysis was performed in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells in order to directly compare the transcriptomes of 5‐aza‐resistant, cisplatin‐resistant, and DNMT3B‐knockdown cells. We chose 2102EP‐AH2A2 and 2102EP‐C1 cells as representative 5‐aza and cisplatin cell lines, respectively, for this analysis. Interestingly, at a cutoff of 1.5‐fold and FDR ≤ 0.01, there were many more genes downregulated than upregulated in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells compared to PLK0.1 control cells, 326 downregulated genes, and 63 upregulated genes (Fig.  5A ). This is interesting since it conflicts with the canonical role of DNMT3B in facilitating gene silencing by promoter DNA methylation [ 23 ]. This trend was present but to a lesser extent in 5‐aza‐resistant 2102EP‐AH2A2 cells with 2091 genes downregulated and 1754 genes upregulated compared to parental cells and reversed to a certain extent in cisplatin‐resistant 2102EP‐C1 cells, with 2030 upregulated genes and 1587 downregulated genes compared to parental cells (Fig.  5A ). This suggests that gene expression in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells may be more similar to 2102EP‐AH2A2 cells than to 2102EP‐C1 cells. Differentially expressed genes in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells are provided in Table  S5 . Similar to 5‐aza‐resistant cells, DNMT3B knockdown in TGCT cells results in a genome‐wide decrease in polycomb target gene expression. (A) Volcano plot indicating the number of significantly upregulated (blue) and downregulated (red) genes in 2102EP‐DNMT3B knockdown cells compared to PLK0.1 control cells. Volcano plot of 5‐aza‐resistant 2102EP‐AH2 vs parental and cisplatin‐resistant 2102EP‐C1 cells vs parent is provided for comparison. Number of genes upregulated and downregulated with a 1.5‐fold cutoff and FDR ≤ 0.01 for each resistant line is indicated. Volcano plots are based on RNA‐seq analysis from biological triplicates. The DNMT3B gene is indicated by circle. (B) Downregulated genes from 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells are enriched for gene sets associated with H3K27 methylation and polycomb targets. GSEA indicating all polycomb related negatively enriched gene sets within the top 50 ranked by NES from 5529 curated gene gets from the MSigDB C2 collection in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells compared to PLK0.1 control cells. (C) Representative gene set enrichment plots. NES, normalized enrichment score. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that genes downregulated in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells were highly significantly enriched for multiple polycomb target gene sets, further supporting that DNMT3B‐knockdown mimics global expression changes in 5‐aza‐resistant cells. Of the top 50 ranked gene sets for downregulated genes in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells compared to PLK0.1 control cells, 15 gene sets were related to polycomb target genes (Fig.  5B,C ). There were no major trends seen for upregulated genes in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells. The top 50 positively and negatively enriched gene sets for 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD ranked by normalized enrichment score is provided in Table  S6 . This analysis strongly demonstrates that DNMT3B knockdown alone closely mimics the global downregulation of polycomb target genes seen in 5‐aza cells (Fig.  2B,C ). We previously reported the reciprocal pattern for cisplatin‐resistant cells including 2102EP‐C1 where these same polycomb target gene sets were enriched in upregulated genes [ 15 ]. BART analysis also predicted polycomb component binding at the promoters of the downregulated genes in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells, which included EZH2, JARID2, and SUZ12 in the top 20 predicted binders (Table  S7 ). Thus far, the data suggest there is a reciprocal relationship in polycomb target genes expression between 5‐aza‐ and cisplatin‐resistant cells with polycomb targets downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells. Furthermore, the data suggest that downregulation of polycomb target genes also occurred in DNMT3B‐knockdown cells. To investigate this relationship further, we analyzed the degree of overlap in differentially expressed genes (1.5‐fold change, FDR ≤ 0.01 compared to parental control cells) between 2102EP‐AH2A2, 2102EP‐C1, and 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells. The identity of the overlap genes is provided in Table  S8 . Approximately 47% of the genes downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and 49% of the genes upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells overlapped between the two cell lines (Fig.  6A ). Remarkably, of the genes downregulated in DNMT3B knockdown cells, 85% were also downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and 75% were also upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells (Fig.  6A ). These overlap genes were highly enriched in polycomb target genes sets from the GSEA database (Fig.  6B  and Table  S9 ). These data suggest that DNMT3B‐knockdown results in downregulation of the same polycomb target genes downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells. Genome‐wide overlap analysis between 5‐aza‐resistant, cisplatin‐resistant, and DNMT3B knockdown TGCT cells reveals mutual enrichments in the same polycomb target genes. (A) Venn diagram indicating overlap in differentially expressed genes between genes downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant 2102EP‐AH2A2 cells, upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant 2102EP‐C1 cells, and downregulated in 2102EP‐DNMT3B knockdown cells. Differentially expressed genes are defined as changed 1.5‐fold or greater and an FDR of ≤ 0.01 compared to parental cells or shRNA control cells, respectively. (B) Fisher exact tests against the 5529 curated gene sets of the Broad MSigDB C2 collection performed on the overlap genes between downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells (green), downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and downregulated in DNMT3B‐KD cells (red), and upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells and downregulated in DNMT3B‐KD cells (blue).

Interestingly, we identified previously in 10 isogenic cisplatin‐resistant EC cells including those derived from parental 2102EP, the exact opposite pattern of polycomb gene expression with polycomb target genes being among the most significantly upregulated gene sets [ 15 ]. BART (binding analysis for regulation of transcription) predicts functional transcription factor binding based on more than 6000 ChIP‐seq datasets for over 400 factors in human and mouse cells [ 20 ]. The BART analysis of genes downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells, as compared with parental controls, strongly predicted polycomb complex component binding. The number of distinct PRC1/PRC2‐related components contained in the top 20 predicted transcription factor binders for each line ranged from three to five and included EZH2, JARID2, SUZ12, and EED (Table  S4 ). These results further suggest the polycomb pathway is a major mediator in regulating downregulated genes in the 5‐aza‐resistant cells. In contrast, BART analysis of cisplatin‐resistant cells demonstrated polycomb component binding enrichment in upregulated genes [ 15 ]. To further probe the reciprocal nature of 5‐aza‐ and cisplatin‐resistant cells, immunoblot and RT‐PCR analyses were performed. We focused on the three 5‐aza‐ and three cisplatin‐resistant 2102EP lines used for current and prior RNA‐seq analysis (Fig.  2A ) [ 15 ]. Remarkably, all three 5‐aza‐resistant 2102EP cell lines had a dramatic increase in the polycomb marks H3K27me3 and H2AUbK119 compared to parental cells, while, as previously shown, the cisplatin‐resistant cells had decreased expression of these marks (Fig.  3A ) [ 15 ]. DNMT3B levels were also assessed, since we have previously shown that hypersensitivity of EC cells to 5‐aza is dependent on high‐level expression of DNMT3B [ 5 ,  6 ]. Interestingly, all three 5‐aza‐resistant cells had dramatically decreased expression of DNMT3B, while all three cisplatin‐resistant cells had a dramatic increase in DNMT3B expression compared to parental cells (Fig.  3A ). In contrast, there was minimal change in DNMT1 expression among the cell lines. 5‐aza‐resistant and cisplatin‐resistant testicular cancer cells have reciprocally altered levels of H3K27me3 and DNMT3B. (A) Immunoblot analysis of indicated cell lines (2102EP parent is loaded twice) with antibodies recognizing DNMT3B, DNMT1, H3K27me3, H2AUbK119, and actin. (B–D) Real‐time PCR analysis of mRNA expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, BMI1, EZH2, KDM6A, and KDM6B. Data are the mean of triplicate determinations, and error bars are standard error of the mean. Two‐tailed Student's  t ‐tests were performed for statistical analysis. * P  ≤ 0.05, ** P  ≤ 0.01, *** P  ≤ 0.005, **** P  ≤ 0.001. Each experiment was repeated at least twice with similar results. Real‐time PCR analysis demonstrated substantial downregulated expression of DNMT3B in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and a dramatic upregulated expression of DNMT3B in cisplatin‐resistant cells, consistent with immunoblot analysis and suggesting regulation of DNMT3B in these cell models is at the level of mRNA regulation (Fig.  3B ). In contrast, there were only small changes in mRNA for DNMT1 and DNMT3A between the cell lines. PRC1 component BMI1 was upregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells while downregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells consistent with the changes observed in H2AUbK119 (Fig.  3C ). Expression of EZH2 also followed this same general trend but was less consistently changed between the resistant cells (Fig.  3C ). The H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6B was upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells consistent with the downregulation of H3K27me3 in cisplatin‐resistant cells, but unchanged in the 5‐aza‐resistant cell lines (Fig.  3D ). In contrast, expression of the H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6A was relatively unchanged between the lines (Fig.  3D ). These data suggest that the reciprocal alterations seen in H3K27me3 and H2AUbK119 could be related to changes in expression of certain polycomb components."

        "content": "Our prior work suggested a role for global remodeling of DNA methylation in the upregulation of polycomb target gene expression in cisplatin‐resistant TGCT cells [ 16 ]. To investigate whether changes in DNMT3B play a causal role in altering polycomb signaling and 5‐aza and cisplatin sensitivity in TGCT cells, DNMT3B was targeted by shRNA in parental 2102EP cells (Fig.  4A,B ). Note that in some experiments shRNA1 only mediated a partial knockdown of DNMT3B. However, DNMT3B knockdown was stable and persisted for extended cell culture intervals up to several months. DNMT3B shRNA resulted in upregulation of H3K27me3 levels and BMI1 and EZH2 protein expression in 2102EP cells (Fig.  4B ). BMI1 induction was also noted at the mRNA level where little change was noted in mRNA levels of EZH2, KDM6A, and KDM6B upon DNMT3B knockdown (Fig.  4C ). DNMT3B shRNA did not affect levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3A (Fig.  4C ). Notably, DNMT3B shRNA also resulted in resistance to 5‐aza, as we have shown previously [ 5 ,  6 ], but importantly these cells also demonstrated a sensitization to cisplatin (Fig.  4D ). These results suggest that repression of DNMT3B expression alone is sufficient to induce H3K27me3 levels in TGCT cells and that knockdown of DNMT3B mimics the situation seen in 5‐aza‐resistant cells, namely, 5‐aza resistance and heightened cisplatin sensitivity. The results suggest that alterations in DNMT3B may be driving the crosstalk between DNA methylation and polycomb signaling noted in cisplatin‐resistant and 5‐aza‐resistant TGCT cells. DNMT3B‐knockdown results in induction of H3K27me3, BMI1 and EZH2, and confers 5‐aza resistance and cisplatin sensitization to TGCT cells.

        "content": "Our findings suggest a reciprocal regulation of polycomb signaling in cisplatin‐resistant and 5‐aza‐resistant cells. Since 5‐aza resistance could be phenocopied by DNMT3B silencing alone, RNA‐seq analysis was performed in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells in order to directly compare the transcriptomes of 5‐aza‐resistant, cisplatin‐resistant, and DNMT3B‐knockdown cells. We chose 2102EP‐AH2A2 and 2102EP‐C1 cells as representative 5‐aza and cisplatin cell lines, respectively, for this analysis. Interestingly, at a cutoff of 1.5‐fold and FDR ≤ 0.01, there were many more genes downregulated than upregulated in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells compared to PLK0.1 control cells, 326 downregulated genes, and 63 upregulated genes (Fig.  5A ). This is interesting since it conflicts with the canonical role of DNMT3B in facilitating gene silencing by promoter DNA methylation [ 23 ]. This trend was present but to a lesser extent in 5‐aza‐resistant 2102EP‐AH2A2 cells with 2091 genes downregulated and 1754 genes upregulated compared to parental cells and reversed to a certain extent in cisplatin‐resistant 2102EP‐C1 cells, with 2030 upregulated genes and 1587 downregulated genes compared to parental cells (Fig.  5A ). This suggests that gene expression in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells may be more similar to 2102EP‐AH2A2 cells than to 2102EP‐C1 cells. Differentially expressed genes in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells are provided in Table  S5 . Similar to 5‐aza‐resistant cells, DNMT3B knockdown in TGCT cells results in a genome‐wide decrease in polycomb target gene expression. (A) Volcano plot indicating the number of significantly upregulated (blue) and downregulated (red) genes in 2102EP‐DNMT3B knockdown cells compared to PLK0.1 control cells. Volcano plot of 5‐aza‐resistant 2102EP‐AH2 vs parental and cisplatin‐resistant 2102EP‐C1 cells vs parent is provided for comparison. Number of genes upregulated and downregulated with a 1.5‐fold cutoff and FDR ≤ 0.01 for each resistant line is indicated. Volcano plots are based on RNA‐seq analysis from biological triplicates. The DNMT3B gene is indicated by circle. (B) Downregulated genes from 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells are enriched for gene sets associated with H3K27 methylation and polycomb targets. GSEA indicating all polycomb related negatively enriched gene sets within the top 50 ranked by NES from 5529 curated gene gets from the MSigDB C2 collection in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells compared to PLK0.1 control cells. (C) Representative gene set enrichment plots. NES, normalized enrichment score. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that genes downregulated in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells were highly significantly enriched for multiple polycomb target gene sets, further supporting that DNMT3B‐knockdown mimics global expression changes in 5‐aza‐resistant cells. Of the top 50 ranked gene sets for downregulated genes in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells compared to PLK0.1 control cells, 15 gene sets were related to polycomb target genes (Fig.  5B,C ). There were no major trends seen for upregulated genes in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells. The top 50 positively and negatively enriched gene sets for 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD ranked by normalized enrichment score is provided in Table  S6 . This analysis strongly demonstrates that DNMT3B knockdown alone closely mimics the global downregulation of polycomb target genes seen in 5‐aza cells (Fig.  2B,C ). We previously reported the reciprocal pattern for cisplatin‐resistant cells including 2102EP‐C1 where these same polycomb target gene sets were enriched in upregulated genes [ 15 ]. BART analysis also predicted polycomb component binding at the promoters of the downregulated genes in 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells, which included EZH2, JARID2, and SUZ12 in the top 20 predicted binders (Table  S7 ). Thus far, the data suggest there is a reciprocal relationship in polycomb target genes expression between 5‐aza‐ and cisplatin‐resistant cells with polycomb targets downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells. Furthermore, the data suggest that downregulation of polycomb target genes also occurred in DNMT3B‐knockdown cells. To investigate this relationship further, we analyzed the degree of overlap in differentially expressed genes (1.5‐fold change, FDR ≤ 0.01 compared to parental control cells) between 2102EP‐AH2A2, 2102EP‐C1, and 2102EP‐DNMT3BKD cells. The identity of the overlap genes is provided in Table  S8 . Approximately 47% of the genes downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and 49% of the genes upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells overlapped between the two cell lines (Fig.  6A ). Remarkably, of the genes downregulated in DNMT3B knockdown cells, 85% were also downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and 75% were also upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells (Fig.  6A ). These overlap genes were highly enriched in polycomb target genes sets from the GSEA database (Fig.  6B  and Table  S9 ). These data suggest that DNMT3B‐knockdown results in downregulation of the same polycomb target genes downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells. Genome‐wide overlap analysis between 5‐aza‐resistant, cisplatin‐resistant, and DNMT3B knockdown TGCT cells reveals mutual enrichments in the same polycomb target genes. (A) Venn diagram indicating overlap in differentially expressed genes between genes downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant 2102EP‐AH2A2 cells, upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant 2102EP‐C1 cells, and downregulated in 2102EP‐DNMT3B knockdown cells. Differentially expressed genes are defined as changed 1.5‐fold or greater and an FDR of ≤ 0.01 compared to parental cells or shRNA control cells, respectively. (B) Fisher exact tests against the 5529 curated gene sets of the Broad MSigDB C2 collection performed on the overlap genes between downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells (green), downregulated in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and downregulated in DNMT3B‐KD cells (red), and upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells and downregulated in DNMT3B‐KD cells (blue). The top 10 gene sets for each comparison based on  P  value are presented."

        "content": "Testicular germ cell tumors can be cured at a high‐rate with conventional cisplatin‐based therapies. However, patients resistant to cisplatin have a very poor prognosis [ 3 ]. The mechanisms to account for the sensitivity and resistance of TGCTs to cisplatin are unclear [ 24 ,  25 ,  26 ]. Although there are no effective alternative or targeted therapies available for cisplatin refractory TGCT patients, recent preclinical and early clinical trial data suggest a subset of cisplatin refractory TGCTs may be hypersensitive to DNA hypomethylating agents [ 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ]. The mechanisms accounting for the hypersensitivity of TGCT cells to hypomethylating agents are entirely unknown apart from a reported dependence on high‐level expression of DNMT3B [ 6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ]. Very few studies have addressed the issue of resistance to hypomethylating agents, and these are mainly centered on acute myeloid leukemia [ 27 ,  28 ]. Biomarkers for both cisplatin and hypomethylating agents in TGCT patients are critically needed as early trials have indicated that only a subset of cisplatin refractory patients may benefit from hypomethylating agents [ 12 ,  13 ,  14 ]. The present study directly addresses mechanisms of TGCT hypersensitivity to DNA hypomethylating agents through the derivation of unique isogenic 5‐aza‐resistant cell models. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 5‐aza resistance is associated with H3K27me3‐mediated downregulation of polycomb target genes and downregulation of the expression of DNMT3B. In addition,  de novo  pharmacogenomic studies in the isogenic 5‐aza‐resistant cells and prior isogenic cisplatin‐resistant cells revealed that the polycomb pathway and DNA methylation are opposing interconnected epigenetic drivers of cisplatin and hypomethylating agent sensitivity in TGCTs. Increased 5‐aza sensitivity in cisplatin‐resistant cells validates prior anecdotal evidence that cisplatin resistance may sensitize TGCT cells to hypomethylating agents and suggests that polycomb/DNA methylation remodeling is one mechanism to account for hypomethylating therapy hypersensitivity in cisplatin refractory TGCTs. Reciprocally and unexpectedly, 5‐aza‐resistant cells were more sensitive to cisplatin. Together, these findings provide further rationale for the combined use of these two therapeutics for treating TGCTs. We have also begun to generate 5‐aza‐resistant cells from other parental TGCT cells, although this has been difficult while avoiding terminal differentiation. Some of these lines also appear to have similar polycomb alterations as in 5‐aza‐resistant 2102EP cells, but to a lesser extent. This suggests that there are likely other mechanisms of 5‐aza resistance in TGCT cells. We previously showed that H3K27me3 was downregulated with cisplatin resistance and that cisplatin‐resistant cells have global DNA hypermethylation [ 15 ,  16 ]. In contrast, less abundant hypomethylation in cisplatin‐resistant cells was associated with H3K27me3 and polycomb target gene loci as part of a bidirectional shift between gene promoter and gene body DNA methylation that was associated with upregulation of polycomb targets and downregulation of tumor suppressor genes [ 16 ]. Our data thus suggest a complex relationship exists between DNA methylation and H3K27me3, the remodeling of which may have been selected for during acquired cisplatin and 5‐aza resistance. The interconnection between polycomb and DNA methylation has been studied in other cell contexts including pluripotent embryonal stem cells [ 29 ,  30 ,  31 ,  32 ]. It would be interesting to directly test this relationship in future work with H3K27me3 and polycomb cistrome and chromatin accessibility ATAC‐seq analyses in TGCT cells. Further, important future work will be to confirm whether the epigenetic and gene expression changes highlighted here extend to clinical cisplatin‐resistant TGCTs. Recent studies suggest that global DNA hypermethylation may be a key factor in mediating cisplatin resistance in TGCTs [ 16 ,  17 ]. The current work reveals that DNMT3B is also reciprocally altered with 5‐aza and cisplatin resistance. Prior studies have demonstrated that knockdown of highly expressed DNMT3B in TGCT cells confers resistance to hypomethylating agents [ 5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ]. Interestingly, the 5‐aza‐resistant cells derived in the present study spontaneously downregulated DNMT3B, while cisplatin‐resistant cells greatly induced DNMT3B expression. This again suggests an interconnected epigenetic mechanism linking 5‐aza and cisplatin sensitivity/resistance in TGCTs involving polycomb and DNA methylation. Finally, DNMT3B knockdown alone phenocopied 5‐aza resistance including repression of polycomb target genes, 5‐aza resistance, and cisplatin sensitization, suggesting that DNMT3B plays an important role in the crosstalk between DNA methylation and polycomb in TGCT cells. We found that DNMT3B knockdown induced the protein expression of EZH2 and BMI1; however, only BMI1 mRNA was increased, suggesting that DNMT3B knockdown may also have post‐transcriptional effects on polycomb components. Interestingly, DNMT3B knockdown in parental TGCT cells resulted in many more downregulated genes than upregulated genes, suggesting that the high levels of DNMT3B in TGCT cells may have functions beyond the canonical role of promoting repression of gene expression [ 23 ]. Interestingly, the H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6B was upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells. Targeting H3K27me3 demethylases like KDM6B could be a strategy for treating cisplatin‐resistant tumors. We have previously demonstrated that inducing H3K27 methylation with GSK‐J4, an inhibitor of both KDM6A and KDM6B H3K27me3 demethylases, increased cisplatin sensitivity of cisplatin‐resistant TGCT cells [ 15 ]. Upregulation of KDM6B also provides a mechanistic explanation for the low basal levels of H3K27me3 in cisplatin‐resistant 2102EP cells. It will be important to validate our findings in cisplatin‐sensitive versus cisplatin‐resistant nonseminoma patients. Patient material could be interrogated for H3K27me3 levels and BMI1, EZH2, KDM6B, and DNMT3B levels by immunohistochemistry. We predict that patients resistant to cisplatin may have high levels of DNMT3B and KDM6B, and low levels of H3K27me3, EZH2, and BMI1. These patients would be predicted to be hypersensitive to 5‐aza and thus candidates for hypomethylation therapy with or without cisplatin. These patents would also be candidates for combination therapy with a KDM6A/KDM6B inhibitor and cisplatin. The precise nature of how H3K27me3 and DNA methylation alters cisplatin and 5‐aza sensitivity will require further studies. Interestingly, DNMT3B knockdown alone was able to repress many of the same polycomb target genes that were repressed in 5‐aza‐resistant cells and upregulated in cisplatin‐resistant cells. These data suggest that alterations in chromatin context as revealed by polycomb target gene expression and likely downstream of DNMT3B/DNA methylation are a driving factor in TGCT cell response to cisplatin and 5‐aza. Whether these results hold true for other cancer therapeutics in TGCT cells awaits further study. In other cell contexts, studies have shown that H3K27me3 and other histone marks have the ability to recruit or regulate distinct components of the DNA damage and repair pathways [ 33 ,  34 ,  35 ,  36 ,  37 ,  38 ,  39 ,  40 ]. It will be interesting to assess how altering DNMT3B and polycomb components effect these endpoints in TGCT cells in future studies. Another potential mechanism to consider is the direct regulation of DNA damage response and repair gene expression by DNA methylation and polycomb remodeling in TGCT cells as recent reports have shown some genes involved in these pathways can be regulated by DNA methylation in TGCT cells and tumors [ 41 ,  42 ,  43 ]. However, we did not detect a clear signal for these family of genes in our transcriptome analyses. Our ongoing work is centered on further elucidating the mechanism by which DNA and histone methylation are influencing 5‐aza and cisplatin sensitivity. However, these mechanisms are likely complex and are beyond to scope of the current study. Our two leading hypothesis currently are that these epigenetic marks may be directly influencing the recruitment of DNA repair or DNA damage pathway components, or alternatively, a comparable amount of DNA damage is occurring but cells are responding differently based on the chromatin context, for example, more open chromatin allowing for more binding of p53 to target gene promoters. Thus far in appears that there is a comparable amount of DNA damage and repair in parental, 5‐aza‐, and cisplatin‐resistant cells basally and in response to cisplatin and 5‐aza."

In that, 5‐aza‐resistant cells are more sensitive to cisplatin and cisplatin‐resistant cells are more sensitive to 5‐aza. Together, our findings support the involvement of a novel crosstalk mechanism between two epigenetic pathways, global DNA methylation, and polycomb, in mediating the unique hypersensitivity of TGCTs to cisplatin and hypomethylating agents. This is precisely in line with the growing realization that the etiology and progression of TGCTs may be especially dominated by epigenetic dysregulation. The cell models reported here may have value in identifying biomarkers to guide the use of cisplatin and hypomethylating agents for the treatment of TGCT patients."

    "abstract": "SUMMARY Germ-cell testicular cancer (GCTC) is a malignant neoplasm derived from the primordial germ cell. Although it accounts for approximately 1% of all malignancies in men, it is the most common cancer of younger male population, with the highest incidence between ages 15 and 35. Testicular cancer incidence rate has risen globally over the past several decades, with the average increase in the incidence of testicular cancer in Croatia of 7%  per annum  from the year 1983 to 2007. Two main groups are seminomas and non-seminomas, each accounting for 50% of cases, and they differ in treatment modalities and response to therapy. Despite increase in the incidence rate, a promising circumstance is that GCTC has become a model of curable cancer. Because of advances in diagnostic procedures, sophisticated radiation techniques and especially the introduction of cisplatin based chemotherapy protocols together with advanced postchemotherapy surgical techniques, curability is expected in about 95% of all patients diagnosed with testicular cancer and over 70% of patients with advanced disease. In this review, we will focus on treatment strategies of primary GCTC.",

        "content": "Germ-cell testicular cancer (GCTC) is a malignant neoplasm derived from the primordial germ cell. It normally occurs inside the testicles, but in cases of errors during embryonal development (5 percent of cases) it can arise in extragonadal locations (cerebellum, pineal gland, mediastinum, retroperitoneum). Although it accounts for approximately 1% of all malignancies in men, it is the most common cancer of younger male population, with the highest incidence between ages 15 and 35 ( 1 ,  2 ). According to the latest data from the Croatian National Cancer Registry from 2014, the incidence rate of all newly diagnosed patients with testicular cancer was 9.4/100 000, with the highest incidence rate of 28/100 000 between the ages 30 and 34 years ( 3 ). Testicular cancer incidence rate has risen globally over the past several decades, with average increase in the incidence of testicular cancer in Croatia of 7%  per annum  from the year 1983 to 2007, with the projected increase in the incidence of testicular cancer of 72% by the year 2025 ( 4 ,  5 ). The common influence of genetic predisposition and environmental factors plays a role in testicular cancer incidence rate upsurge. Contrary to current beliefs, there is no correlation between testicular cancer and testicular trauma, motorcycle driving, horseback riding, vasectomy, viral infections, or longer exposure to high temperatures ( 2 ). The best characterized risk factor is cryptorchidism, where the earlier time of orchiopexy reduces the risk of testicular cancer. Another known risk factor is positive family history with 8-10 fold increased risk in siblings of a person with testicular cancer and 4-6 fold in the son of a person with testicular cancer. In some other genetic disorders such as Klinefelter’s syndrome, Down’s syndrome and testicular dysgenesis syndrome, a higher rate of testicular cancer incidence is seen, as it is also seen in men diagnosed earlier with primary testicular cancer ( 1 ). It is thought that tumorigenesis starts in primordial germ cell that fails to differentiate into spermatogonia. This malignant transformation happens  in utero  and results in a precursor lesion known as intratubular germ-cell neoplasia (ITGCN) ( 6 ). Until the onset of testicular hormone changes during puberty, ITGCN does not have invasive potential. After hormonal and other yet unknown influences, ITGCN has the ability to develop into germinal and somatic malignant tissues. Seminoma is one of the main histologic types of GCTC, which is derived from transformed germ cell that resembles gonocyte, but is blocked in differentiation. Another main type of GCTC is non-seminoma, which often consists of several other histologic subtypes. The most undifferentiated type is embryonal carcinoma, which can go in extraembryonal differentiation predisposing to choriocarcinoma and yolk sac tumor, or it can go in somatic differentiation predisposing to teratoma ( 7 ,  8 ). These two main groups, seminomas and non-seminomas, account for 50% of cases each, and differ in treatment modalities and response to therapy. Despite increase in the incidence rate, a promising circumstance is that GCTC has become a model of curable cancer. Because of advances in diagnostic procedures, sophisticated radiation techniques, and especially the introduction of cisplatin based chemotherapy protocols together with advanced postchemotherapy surgical techniques, curability is expected in about 95% of all patients diagnosed with testicular cancer and over 70% of patients with advanced disease ( 9 ,  10 )."

Testicular biopsy should never be performed because of the tumor seeding risk. Measurement of beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG), alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should help confirm the diagnosis. Raised LDH is not specific for germ-cell tumor; rather it is an indicator of disease volume ( 11 ). Radical inguinal orchiectomy with detailed histopathologic report on tumor histology, size, and presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion is a diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Disease staging should be done with computed tomography imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and measurement of postorchiectomy tumor markers (bHCG, AFP and LDH). Testicular cancer is categorized in three stages according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer, 8 th  edition (AJCC) ( 12 ). In this review, we will focus on treatment strategies for primary GCTC."

        "content": "Stage I is defined as a tumor limited to the testis, without retroperitoneal lymph node involvement or visceral metastases and with normal postorchiectomy serum tumor markers at primary diagnosis. About 80% of patients are diagnosed at this stage, and the majority are cured with orchiectomy alone. Following orchiectomy, the 5-year relapse rates are 15%-20%. Relapses are most likely to occur within the first two years after orchidectomy and relapse rate declines beyond the fifth year ( 13 ). Following orchiectomy, there are 3 options recommended for the management of stage I seminoma, as follows: active surveillance, adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy to para-aortic lymph nodes, or adjuvant 1-2 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin, dosed at the area under the curve (AUC) of 7 ( 12 ). The most encouraging fact is that in case of relapse, the overall 5-year disease specific survival is 99%, independent of the 3 management options mentioned above ( 1 ). Many groups have tried to investigate the risk factors in predicting relapse to ease identification of patients that should be allocated to active surveillance and those that should receive adjuvant treatment. Primary tumor size greater than 4 cm and rete testis invasion have shown promising results as risk factors. In subsequent studies, there was insufficient evidence to support these findings, so the routine use of these predictive factors is not currently recommended ( 9 ). On active surveillance, there is a relapse rate of 20% ( 12 ). This means that 80% of patients on active surveillance will be cured without any further treatment. With adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy, they would be unnecessarily exposed to the potential acute and long term toxicities without improvement in overall survival. The goal of active surveillance is to spare 80% of patients of toxic treatments and in case of relapse, they can still be cured in 99% of cases ( 9 ). According to these data, active surveillance is the preferred option in relevant guidelines and in our Referral Center for Treatment of Germ Cell Tumors and Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors in Croatia. The potential disadvantages of active surveillance are the lack of patient compliance and exposure to imaging related radiation. Alternatives to active surveillance are either adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy. In both options, the relapse rate after treatment is about 4% ( 1 ). Although the dose and field of radiation was reduced over the past 20 years to 20 Gy administered in 10 daily 2.0 fractions to para-aortic and/or ipsilateral iliac lymph nodes, adjuvant radiotherapy in stage I seminoma has been abandoned in many major medical centers because of the long term risk of secondary malignancies and cardiovascular toxicity ( 1 ,  2 ). Adjuvant chemotherapy with 1-2 cycles of carboplatin dosed at the AUC of 7 did not improve overall survival and due to added toxicity it is not the first option for patients who are willing to undergo surveillance program ( 9 ,  15 ). Stage II is defined as a tumor that involves testis and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, without visceral metastases and with normal or raised postorchiectomy serum tumor markers at primary diagnosis. About 15% to 20% of patients diagnosed with seminoma are classified as having stage II disease ( 15 ). Postorchiectomy treatment options for stage II seminoma include radiotherapy to para-aortic and ipsilateral iliac lymph nodes to the cumulative dose of 30-36 Gy, multi agent cisplatin based chemotherapy with 3 cycles of cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin protocol (PEB protocol) or 4 cycles of cisplatin, etoposide protocol (PE protocol). Stage II is divided by AJCC staging system based on the size of involved nodes into stage IIA (nodes <2 cm), IIB (nodes 2-5 cm) and IIC (nodes >5 cm). For stage IIC, there is no debate about the indication for chemotherapy, but for IIA and IIB stages there are some differences among high-volume centers regarding optimal choice of therapy ( 16 ,  17 ). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) testicular cancer guidelines treatment plan is based on dividing stage II into low volume disease and bulky disease, depending on the maximal size of lymph node mass. In low volume disease, which is defined by involved lymph nodes smaller than 3 cm, radiotherapy is preferred to chemotherapy. In situations where more extensive lymph node involvement is present, chemotherapy is preferable. Bulky disease is defined by involved lymph nodes greater than 3 cm, and in this case chemotherapy is preferred to radiotherapy ( 1 ,  12 ). The European Society for Medical Oncology practice guidelines recommend chemotherapy or radiotherapy for stage IIA, whereas chemotherapy is the preferred option for stages IIB and IIC ( 18 ). Recent studies predominantly recommend chemotherapy for stage IIA due to the same relapse rates for chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Accordingly, chemotherapy is becoming a more commonly utilized modality for stage IIA as it is for stages IIB and IIC ( 17 ,  19 ). After completing the initial therapy, patients are evaluated with serum tumor markers and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan. It should be done 6-8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy to reduce the incidence of false-positive results. Patients with complete response to primary treatment need only surveillance. In cases where residual retroperitoneal mass is metabolically active, greater than 3 cm, with normal levels of tumor markers, there is a higher possibility of residual seminoma. A biopsy of residual mass should be considered before decision on further treatment option. Postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) is difficult to perform in case of pure seminoma due to desmoplastic reaction and adherence to main blood vessels. In cases of biopsy proven residual viable seminoma, salvage treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) is indicated, while surveillance is preferable otherwise. In patients with positive PET/CT scan and rising tumor markers, the option is salvage chemotherapy ( 12 ,  18 ). Stage I is defined as a tumor limited to the testis, without retroperitoneal lymph node involvement or visceral metastases and without increased postorchiectomy serum tumor markers at primary diagnosis. About 70% of patients are diagnosed at this stage. The overall relapse rate is 30% following orchiectomy. This means that 70% of patients are cured by orchiectomy alone, and by receiving adjuvant treatment they would be unnecessarily exposed to the potential adverse events ( 20 ). The investigated risk factors for predicting disease relapse include the presence of lymphovascular invasion and the predominant subtype of embryonal carcinoma in the orchiectomy histologic specimen. Because of inconclusive data, predominant embryonal carcinoma as a risk factor is not accepted in routine practice. Based on the absence or presence of lymphovascular invasion, stage I non-seminoma can be divided into low-risk stage IA and high-risk stage IB. The relapse rate is 15%-20% in stage IA and 40%-50% in stage IB without adjuvant treatment ( 2 ). Following orchiectomy, there are 3 recommended options for the management of stage I non-seminoma, including active surveillance, adjuvant chemotherapy with 1-2 cycles of chemotherapy with PEB protocol, or primary nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (p-RPLND). Each option has a cure rate of 99% ( 20 ). At our Referral Center, as in other European high-volume centers, the preferred option for stage IA is active surveillance and for stage IB adjuvant chemotherapy with 1 cycle of PEB protocol. Adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with the lowest risk of disease recurrence (1%-5%) among the 3 treatment options. The main disadvantage is the toxicity risk, which is related to the number of PEB protocol cycles. Some findings confirm that applying 1 instead of 2 cycles of adjuvant PEB chemotherapy significantly reduces toxicity without a major increase in the risk of relapse (90%-95%) ( 21 ,  22 ). If only 1 cycle of PEB chemotherapy is planned, chest radiography with tumor markers within 1 week and abdominal computed tomography within 4 weeks before treatment are necessary to confirm that the patient is still in stage I. The recommendations concerning treatment options differ among high-volume centers. The preferred option for stage IA is active surveillance, and the alternative options are p-RPLND and chemotherapy. The preferred option for stage IB is chemotherapy, and the alternative options are p-RPLND and active surveillance ( 9 ). Advantages of p-RPLND include reduction in the need for chemotherapy, complete staging of the retroperitoneum, minimized relapse rates in the retroperitoneum, and reduced period of only 1 year of radiological monitoring after negative p-RPLND. The p-RPLND is a therapeutic option in the case of occult stage II, especially if chemoresistant teratoma is found. Some experts even consider p-RPLND as the preferred option for patients with teratoma and somatic transformation in primary tumor ( 18 ,  20 ). Although it is not frequently used today, p-RPLND is an option for patients who refuse chemotherapy treatment and do not want to be in surveillance program, especially if they have a 50% risk of relapse ( 2 ,  9 ). Active surveillance is rarely offered to patients in stage IB because of higher relapse rates, with good compliance as a critical issue when this treatment modality is commenced. Those who experience relapse during active surveillance program should be treated with chemotherapy ( 9 ). Stage II is defined as a tumor that involves the testis and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, without visceral metastases and with normal or raised postorchiectomy serum tumor markers at primary diagnosis. It is divided depending on the size of involved lymph nodes in stages IIA (nodes <2 cm), IIB (nodes 2-5 cm) and IIC (nodes >5 cm) ( 12 ). For stage IIC, there is a universal consensus about the indication for postorchiectomy chemotherapy with 3 cycles of PEB protocol or 4 cycles of PE protocol. On the contrary, there are some differences among high-volume centers concerning optimal choice of therapy for stages IIA and IIB, which depends on the level of postorchiectomy tumor markers ( 1 ). For stage IIA with negative tumor markers, the European and NCCN guidelines recommend close follow up of the suspected lymph node involvement. In case of volume progression, treatment options can be p-RPLND or chemotherapy with 3 cycles of PEB protocol or 4 cycles of PE protocol. In case of positive tumor markers, treatment options are the above-mentioned chemotherapeutic protocols. For stage IIB with negative tumor markers and surgically manageable lymph node involvement, the treatment option in highly selected cases can be p-RPLND. In all other cases, the treatment option is chemotherapy, as mentioned above ( 12 ,  18 ). After primary treatment with p-RPLND, adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment should be considered depending on the number and size of positive lymph nodes. After primary treatment with chemotherapy, patients are evaluated by serum tumor markers and radiological imaging. If complete remission is achieved, which means negative tumor markers and retroperitoneal lymph nodes smaller than 1 cm, no further treatment is needed. In case of negative tumor markers and residual lymph nodes greater than 1 cm, bilateral PC-RPLND should be performed ( 1 ,  2 ). PC-RPLND is diagnostically important to differentiate the type of tumor mass, and in case of teratoma it is the therapeutic option since teratoma is chemo- and radio-resistant. In PC-RPLND histology specimens, necrosis can be found in 40%-50%, teratoma in 35%-40% and viable germ cell carcinoma in 10%-15% of cases ( 23 ). Only in case of viable germ cell carcinoma, further adjuvant treatment with 2 cycles of conventional chemotherapy should be considered ( 12 ). Some studies have shown the existence of residual teratoma in subcentimeter retroperitoneal nodes following chemotherapy, but PC-RPLND on such lymph nodes did not improve the overall outcome ( 24 ). Stage III is defined as a tumor that has spread to distant lymph nodes or to any other organ. After the new risk stratification model was published by the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) in 1997, treatment guideline has been tailored accordingly. The model classifies patients with advanced disease into good, intermediate and poor prognosis groups based on the level of tumor markers and the location of primary and metastatic germ cell tumor ( 1 ). About 60% of all metastatic cases are classified as good-risk disease, with 5-year overall survival rate of 91%. Seminoma stages IIIA and IIIB and non-seminoma stage IIIA fall into that category. Following orchiectomy, the preferred regimen for good-risk patients is 3 cycles of PEB protocol, which showed the same cure benefit as 4 cycles, but with significant reduction of toxicity ( 13 ). For patients who cannot receive bleomycin, treatment option is 4 cycles of PE protocol. Although some trials showed advantages of treatment with 3 cycles of PEB protocol over 4 cycles of PE protocol, the results were not statistically significant. The cure rate with chemotherapy is about 90% ( 11 ,  13 ). About 26% of all metastatic cases are classified as intermediate-risk disease with 5-year overall survival rate of 79%, and about 14% of metastatic cases are classified as poor-risk with 5-year overall survival rate of 48%. Seminoma stage IIIC and non-seminoma stage IIIB fall into intermediate risk, and non-seminoma stage IIIC falls into poor risk category. The preferred postorchiectomy regimen for those patients is 4 cycles of PEB protocol. In patients for whom bleomycin is not acceptable, treatment option is 4 cycles of cisplatin, ifosfamide and etoposide (PEI protocol). There was no statistically significant difference in the outcome compared to 4 cycles of PEB protocol, but it caused greater myelotoxicity and genitourinary toxicity. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support is recommended whenever PEI protocols are chosen. A combination of cisplatin, ifosfamide and paclitaxel (TIP protocol) has also shown promising efficacy as first-line therapy in intermediate/poor risk patients. There is an ongoing phase 2 trial comparing PEB and TIP protocols in those patients ( NCT01873326 ) ( 11 ,  13 ). The cure rate for intermediate risk patients treated by chemotherapy is about 80% and for poor-risk patients 50%-60% ( 1 ). High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as the first-line therapy in intermediate/poor-risk patients did not show survival advantage over standard treatment with PEB or PEI protocol, and thus it is not recommended in routine use. Some investigators think it should be considered in selected poor-risk patients with unsatisfactory tumor marker decline after first or second cycle of PEB chemotherapy, those with initial brain metastases and patients with mediastinal primary tumor ( 1 ,  13 ). After primary treatment with chemotherapy, patients with non-seminoma are evaluated with serum tumor markers and computed tomography imaging. If complete remission is achieved, no further treatment is needed. In case of negative tumor markers and residual disease, all sites of residual retroperitoneal and extraperitoneal disease should be surgically removed. Unlike lung, liver and neck disease, the role of surgery in patients with brain metastasis is less common because of the efficacy of new radiation techniques combined ( 25 ). Patients with stage III seminoma are evaluated with tumor markers and PET/CT scan 6-8 weeks after primary treatment with chemotherapy. Depending on the results, further procedure is similar as in stage II seminoma ( 1 ,  2 ). Stage IS is defined as raised postorchiectomy markers without radiological evidence of disease. Before starting the treatment, other causes of raised tumor markers must be excluded. Elevated levels of bHCG can be seen in marijuana users and in patients with mononucleosis, or because of cross reactivity with luteinizing hormone, while increased AFP can be a sign of liver disease ( 26 ). Sustained rise in tumor marker levels is an indication for salvage chemotherapy with the exception of isolated high LDH, as it can be elevated in various medical conditions. Stage IS falls into good-risk category and patients with non-seminoma are treated with 3 cycles of PEB protocol or 4 cycles of PE protocol. The preferred treatment is chemotherapy because of the high probability of disease dissemination. Stage IS seminoma is a rare condition and patients are treated with primary radiotherapy ( 12 ). Up to 30% of patients will have relapse or progressive disease after first-line cisplatin based chemotherapy, which is diagnosed during post-treatment follow-up as an increase in tumor marker levels or/and radiographic progression ( 11 ). In case of isolated tumor marker increase and absence of radiographic progression, relapse in brain or second primary in the contralateral testis must be excluded. Other causes of raised tumor markers should also be ruled out ( 26 ). The choice of first salvage treatment/second-line therapy is still a matter of debate. There are two salvage approaches, conventional-dose chemotherapy (CDCT) and HDCT followed by ASCT. Determining when to treat with CDCT or with HDCT has been investigated throughout the last three decades with predominantly retrospective analyses, which showed possible benefit from HDCT compared to CDCT. The only prospective trial that compared CDCT and HDCT in first salvage treatment failed to prove any significant difference ( 13 ,  27 ,  28 ). The NCCN guidelines recommend CDCT for patients with favorable prognostic factors (low volume of disease, low tumor markers, complete response to first-line chemotherapy) and high-dose programs for patients with unfavorable prognostic factors ( 12 ). The International Prognostic Factor Study Group categorizes relapsed patients into five prognostic groups, from very low-risk to very high-risk group. Accordingly, some investigators propose the use of HDCT followed by ASCT only in high-risk groups, whereas others propose it in all groups except for the very low-risk group ( 1 ,  13 ). Currently, a prospective randomized phase 3 trial (TIGER) is comparing CDCT with HDCT. The results should provide answer about the most efficient first salvage approach and elucidate which risk group requires HDCT followed by ASCT as first salvage treatment ( 11 ,  14 ). Three chemotherapy options in CDCT include the TIP protocol, the combination of cisplatin, ifosfamide and vinblastine (VeIP protocol) and PEI protocol in a rare subgroup of patients who did not receive etoposide as part of first-line therapy ( 26 ,  29 ). There are no head-to-head studies comparing these three protocols, but TIP protocol has become the preferred regimen owing to better results of durable complete response as compared to VeIP protocol ( 11 ). The GETUG phase II trial incorporated gemcitabine in cisplatin and ifosfamide combination for the first time. The so-called GIP protocol showed efficacy as first salvage therapy, especially in patients with preexisting neuropathy ( 13 ,  29 ). A second salvage option/third-line therapy is HDCT, including high doses of carboplatin and etoposide. First choice of HDCT regimen is the protocol which consists of 2 cycles of citoreductive therapy and stem cell mobilization with paclitaxel and ifosfamide, followed by 3 cycles of high dose chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide (CE) with stem cell transplantation. Another choice is citoreductive therapy and stem cell mobilization with PEI protocol, followed by 2 cycles of high dose CE regimen and supported with stem cell transplantation ( 13 ,  26 ,  29 ). After first salvage treatment, secondary resections of non-seminoma residual masses greater than 1 cm are mandatory to improve treatment outcome ( 13 ). Relapses after the first salvage treatment are very challenging to treat due to cisplatin resistance. Therapy options for second salvage treatment/third-line therapy are combinations of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin together with paclitaxel and gemcitabine with paclitaxel for patients who did not receive prior paclitaxel therapies ( 13 ,  26 ). Salvage surgery is sometimes needed in combination with chemotherapy if there is a single site of residual disease. Depending on patient performance status and comorbidities, some investigators offer HDCT with ASCT as second salvage therapy ( 29 ). Late relapse is defined as a disease relapse two years after finishing the initial chemotherapeutic treatment. Management is very challenging due to more aggressive histology and development of chemoresistant clones encouraged with previous chemotherapeutic treatment. It is a distinct clinical entity and occurs in about 2%-3% of survivors ( 30 ). Non-seminomas are difficult to cure with only salvage chemotherapy because of higher rates of teratoma existing in relapsed masses, sometimes with somatic malignant differentiation. This fact makes a combination of chemotherapy and surgical resection the preferred option of treatment, if it is technically feasible. Seminomas should be treated with chemotherapy alone. More than 30% of late relapses may occur more than 10 years after the primary treatment and there is a question of lifelong follow-up in patients with GCTC ( 31 ). All the above mentioned was about patients who experience relapse after achieving complete response to primary treatment with cisplatin based chemotherapy. Relapsed patients whose primary treatment did not include cisplatin based chemotherapy, but were managed with postorchiectomy active surveillance, adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy or p-RPLND, should be treated  per  risk status published by the IGCCCG group ( 12 )."

Postorchiectomy treatment options for stage II seminoma include radiotherapy to para-aortic and ipsilateral iliac lymph nodes to the cumulative dose of 30-36 Gy, multi agent cisplatin based chemotherapy with 3 cycles of cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin protocol (PEB protocol) or 4 cycles of cisplatin, etoposide protocol (PE protocol).

PC-RPLND is diagnostically important to differentiate the type of tumor mass, and in case of teratoma it is the therapeutic option since teratoma is chemo- and radio-resistant. In PC-RPLND histology specimens, necrosis can be found in 40%-50%, teratoma in 35%-40% and viable germ cell carcinoma in 10%-15% of cases ( 23 ). Only in case of viable germ cell carcinoma, further adjuvant treatment with 2 cycles of conventional chemotherapy should be considered ( 12 ). Some studies have shown the existence of residual teratoma in subcentimeter retroperitoneal nodes following chemotherapy, but PC-RPLND on such lymph nodes did not improve the overall outcome ( 24 )."

Following orchiectomy, the preferred regimen for good-risk patients is 3 cycles of PEB protocol, which showed the same cure benefit as 4 cycles, but with significant reduction of toxicity ( 13 ). For patients who cannot receive bleomycin, treatment option is 4 cycles of PE protocol. Although some trials showed advantages of treatment with 3 cycles of PEB protocol over 4 cycles of PE protocol, the results were not statistically significant.

Seminoma stage IIIC and non-seminoma stage IIIB fall into intermediate risk, and non-seminoma stage IIIC falls into poor risk category. The preferred postorchiectomy regimen for those patients is 4 cycles of PEB protocol. In patients for whom bleomycin is not acceptable, treatment option is 4 cycles of cisplatin, ifosfamide and etoposide (PEI protocol). There was no statistically significant difference in the outcome compared to 4 cycles of PEB protocol, but it caused greater myelotoxicity and genitourinary toxicity. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support is recommended whenever PEI protocols are chosen. A combination of cisplatin, ifosfamide and paclitaxel (TIP protocol) has also shown promising efficacy as first-line therapy in intermediate/poor risk patients. There is an ongoing phase 2 trial comparing PEB and TIP protocols in those patients ( NCT01873326 ) ( 11 ,  13 ). The cure rate for intermediate risk patients treated by chemotherapy is about 80% and for poor-risk patients 50%-60% ( 1 ). High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as the first-line therapy in intermediate/poor-risk patients did not show survival advantage over standard treatment with PEB or PEI protocol, and thus it is not recommended in routine use. Some investigators think it should be considered in selected poor-risk patients with unsatisfactory tumor marker decline after first or second cycle of PEB chemotherapy, those with initial brain metastases and patients with mediastinal primary tumor ( 1 ,  13 ). After primary treatment with chemotherapy, patients with non-seminoma are evaluated with serum tumor markers and computed tomography imaging. If complete remission is achieved, no further treatment is needed. In case of negative tumor markers and residual disease, all sites of residual retroperitoneal and extraperitoneal disease should be surgically removed. Unlike lung, liver and neck disease, the role of surgery in patients with brain metastasis is less common because of the efficacy of new radiation techniques combined ( 25 ). Patients with stage III seminoma are evaluated with tumor markers and PET/CT scan 6-8 weeks after primary treatment with chemotherapy. Depending on the results, further procedure is similar as in stage II seminoma ( 1 ,  2 )."

        "content": "Stage IS is defined as raised postorchiectomy markers without radiological evidence of disease. Before starting the treatment, other causes of raised tumor markers must be excluded. Elevated levels of bHCG can be seen in marijuana users and in patients with mononucleosis, or because of cross reactivity with luteinizing hormone, while increased AFP can be a sign of liver disease ( 26 ). Sustained rise in tumor marker levels is an indication for salvage chemotherapy with the exception of isolated high LDH, as it can be elevated in various medical conditions. Stage IS falls into good-risk category and patients with non-seminoma are treated with 3 cycles of PEB protocol or 4 cycles of PE protocol. The preferred treatment is chemotherapy because of the high probability of disease dissemination. Stage IS seminoma is a rare condition and patients are treated with primary radiotherapy ( 12 ). Up to 30% of patients will have relapse or progressive disease after first-line cisplatin based chemotherapy, which is diagnosed during post-treatment follow-up as an increase in tumor marker levels or/and radiographic progression ( 11 ). In case of isolated tumor marker increase and absence of radiographic progression, relapse in brain or second primary in the contralateral testis must be excluded. Other causes of raised tumor markers should also be ruled out ( 26 ). The choice of first salvage treatment/second-line therapy is still a matter of debate. There are two salvage approaches, conventional-dose chemotherapy (CDCT) and HDCT followed by ASCT. Determining when to treat with CDCT or with HDCT has been investigated throughout the last three decades with predominantly retrospective analyses, which showed possible benefit from HDCT compared to CDCT. The only prospective trial that compared CDCT and HDCT in first salvage treatment failed to prove any significant difference ( 13 ,  27 ,  28 ). The NCCN guidelines recommend CDCT for patients with favorable prognostic factors (low volume of disease, low tumor markers, complete response to first-line chemotherapy) and high-dose programs for patients with unfavorable prognostic factors ( 12 ). The International Prognostic Factor Study Group categorizes relapsed patients into five prognostic groups, from very low-risk to very high-risk group. Accordingly, some investigators propose the use of HDCT followed by ASCT only in high-risk groups, whereas others propose it in all groups except for the very low-risk group ( 1 ,  13 ). Currently, a prospective randomized phase 3 trial (TIGER) is comparing CDCT with HDCT. The results should provide answer about the most efficient first salvage approach and elucidate which risk group requires HDCT followed by ASCT as first salvage treatment ( 11 ,  14 ). Three chemotherapy options in CDCT include the TIP protocol, the combination of cisplatin, ifosfamide and vinblastine (VeIP protocol) and PEI protocol in a rare subgroup of patients who did not receive etoposide as part of first-line therapy ( 26 ,  29 ). There are no head-to-head studies comparing these three protocols, but TIP protocol has become the preferred regimen owing to better results of durable complete response as compared to VeIP protocol ( 11 ). The GETUG phase II trial incorporated gemcitabine in cisplatin and ifosfamide combination for the first time. The so-called GIP protocol showed efficacy as first salvage therapy, especially in patients with preexisting neuropathy ( 13 ,  29 ). A second salvage option/third-line therapy is HDCT, including high doses of carboplatin and etoposide. First choice of HDCT regimen is the protocol which consists of 2 cycles of citoreductive therapy and stem cell mobilization with paclitaxel and ifosfamide, followed by 3 cycles of high dose chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide (CE) with stem cell transplantation. Another choice is citoreductive therapy and stem cell mobilization with PEI protocol, followed by 2 cycles of high dose CE regimen and supported with stem cell transplantation ( 13 ,  26 ,  29 ). After first salvage treatment, secondary resections of non-seminoma residual masses greater than 1 cm are mandatory to improve treatment outcome ( 13 ). Relapses after the first salvage treatment are very challenging to treat due to cisplatin resistance. Therapy options for second salvage treatment/third-line therapy are combinations of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin together with paclitaxel and gemcitabine with paclitaxel for patients who did not receive prior paclitaxel therapies ( 13 ,  26 ). Salvage surgery is sometimes needed in combination with chemotherapy if there is a single site of residual disease. Depending on patient performance status and comorbidities, some investigators offer HDCT with ASCT as second salvage therapy ( 29 ). Late relapse is defined as a disease relapse two years after finishing the initial chemotherapeutic treatment. Management is very challenging due to more aggressive histology and development of chemoresistant clones encouraged with previous chemotherapeutic treatment. It is a distinct clinical entity and occurs in about 2%-3% of survivors ( 30 ). Non-seminomas are difficult to cure with only salvage chemotherapy because of higher rates of teratoma existing in relapsed masses, sometimes with somatic malignant differentiation. This fact makes a combination of chemotherapy and surgical resection the preferred option of treatment, if it is technically feasible. Seminomas should be treated with chemotherapy alone. More than 30% of late relapses may occur more than 10 years after the primary treatment and there is a question of lifelong follow-up in patients with GCTC ( 31 ). All the above mentioned was about patients who experience relapse after achieving complete response to primary treatment with cisplatin based chemotherapy. Relapsed patients whose primary treatment did not include cisplatin based chemotherapy, but were managed with postorchiectomy active surveillance, adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy or p-RPLND, should be treated  per  risk status published by the IGCCCG group ( 12 )."

The prognosis of such tumors is very poor despite aggressive surgical resection combined with chemotherapy.

In case of PNETs there are some attempts to improve treatment with surgical resections combined with chemotherapy in the adjuvant and metastatic setting. The used combination is cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vinblastine alternating it with ifosfamide and etoposide, as it is thought that peripheral PNETs are part of Ewing sarcoma family ( 33 ). Up to 8% of non-seminomas contain a choriocarcinoma component, and 0.2%-0.6% are pure choriocarcinomas. Choriocarcinomas arise from extraembryonal differentiation and because of trophoblastic phenotype they secrete high levels of bHCG ( 7 ). Because of rapid hematogenous spread to multiple organs (brain, lungs, liver, etc.) with intratumoral bleeding that can be rapidly fatal, those patients should be treated in high-volume centers and treatment strategy must be individualized for every patient. In cases of high-volume disease, chemotherapy should not be delayed because of orchiectomy or sperm banking. Immediate chemotherapy improves survival. In cases of lung metastases, bleomycin should not be given in the first cycle because of potential respiratory failure and first cycle with PE protocol should be shortened in unstable patient to avoid complications of rapid tumor lysis syndrome ( 34 )."

    "abstract": "Background The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 is a core questionnaire designed to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials. It is available in several languages including Danish. The EORTC QLQ-TC26 is a supplemental module developed for patients with testicular cancer, which can be useful in clinical trials. Despite Denmark holding a high prevalence and incidence of testicular cancer, no Danish translation was previously available. This paper describes the translation process and pilot testing of the Danish translation of QLQ-TC26. Methods The English language EORTC QLQ-TC26 was translated into Danish using forward and backward procedures with reconciliation. The translated instrument was assessed in semi structured cognitive interviews in a sample of 10 patients ages 20–56 receiving treatment for testicular cancer. Results In one round of pilot testing, no changes were required for the Danish translation based upon patient comments. The Danish translation was agreed by participants to be both culturally acceptable and semantically comprehensible. Conclusions The pilot testing of the Danish translation of the EORTC QLQ-TC26 was performed in one round of patient interviews; these results support the Danish translation as a comparable instrument to the English language version. However, further validation is required to ensure complete equivalency. These results support the use of the EORTC QLQ-TC26 in future clinical trials conducted with Danish-speaking patients.",

        "content": "Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common cancer in men between the ages of 15–45 years [ 1 ]. During and after treatment, some TC patients and survivors may face detrimental complications, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, infertility and sexual dysfunction [ 2 ,  3 ], while others report health-related quality of life (HRQoL) values similar to the general population when using EORTC HRQoL measuring instruments [ 3 ,  4 ]. However, these prior findings have not evaluated the specific features unique to TC, and many individuals experience lowered HRQoL as result of illness or treatment [ 5 ]. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 (EORTC) is a widely-utilized core questionnaire designed to evaluate HRQoL in cancer patients participating in international clinical trials [ 6 – 8 ]. It is the inherent design of the QLQ-C30 to serve as an all-encompassing keystone for the measurement of HRQoL; this instrument may be supplemented with validated distinct subscales for specific diagnoses and patient populations for more nuanced results [ 9 ]. The EORTC QLQ-TC26 is a supplementary module for the EORTC QLQ-C30 for the assessment of HRQoL in TC patients and TC-specific symptoms currently in Phase IV international field testing [ 10 ]. This instrument consists of 26 questions addressing quality of life within the following subscales: treatment side effects, treatment satisfaction, future perspective, job problems, family problems, infertility, communication, body image problems, sexual activity, sexual problems, sexual enjoyment, and testicular implant satisfaction. Answers are selected based upon patient-reported severity or intensity of TC-specific symptoms on a four-point Likert scale from ‘not at all’ to ‘very much’, with a reference frame of 1 week [ 11 ]. This instrument is designed for the use of testicular cancer patients both receiving active treatment, and survivors of testicular cancer, making it a versatile tool for this population. The instrument was additionally designed to be used in coordination with the original EORTC QLQ-C30 30-item instrument for thorough HRQoL assessment; as such, the 26 items are numbered for usage after the EORTC QLQ-C30, as questions 31–56. Currently, the EORTC QLQ-TC26 is available in several languages, including Dutch, English, German, Italian and Spanish [ 10 ]. However, this specific instrument is not available in a Danish translation. Denmark holds the second highest incidence and prevalence of testicular cancer in Europe [ 12 ,  13 ], and this population is easily followed due to the presence of a national testicular cancer registry [ 14 ]. As such, the testicular cancer population in Denmark is a valuable population for further studies on QoL. A Danish translation of the QLQ-TC26 would allow for comprehensive evaluation of HRQoL in TC patient populations, as well as encourage comparison and coordination between different HRQoL data resources. The aim of this study was to develop and pilot test a Danish translation of the English language version of the EORTC QLQ-TC26 for inclusion in future clinical trials."

The English-language EORTC QLQ-TC26 was translated according to the protocol and guidelines outlined by the EORTC Quality of Life Group [ 15 ]. The translation was produced by a forward–backward procedure, in which two native Danish speakers with academic English translation experience independently translated the English EORTC QLQ-TC26 into Danish [ 15 – 17 ]. The two translations were compared by the steering group for any discrepancies. Consensus was achieved based on the following criteria: the translation should be in accordance with the original English text; Danish culture must be taken into account in choosing the right words and in construction of sentences; traditional standards are to be considered in terms of prior communication with patients and health care classification in response categories. The compiled result was then back-translated by two native English speakers fluent in Danish with experience in academic Danish translation back into English. All translations, and a report detailing action thus far, were then sent to a representative from the EORTC Quality of Life Group, and were proofread by an independent translator. Results were described in an interim report, and then were assessed via pilot testing. Pilot testing of the Danish translated version of EORTC QLQ-TC26 was performed by individual semi-structured interviews with 10 patients. This sample size was decided based on the recommended number of participants for translation pilot testing specified in the EORTC translation protocol [ 15 ]. The interviews were performed by a research nurse specialized in oncology. The interviews took place on the clinical ward after the patient’s consultation with an oncologist consecutively in the order they were scheduled in clinic for the relevant day. Inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: 1) A diagnosis of TC, 2) Ability to speak and read the Danish language, 3) At least one prior treatment with chemotherapy. Due to ethical concerns, patients who were about to receive a negative message (e.g. progression of disease) were not addressed for interview. The patients were introduced to the project by the interviewer, and the aim of the project was described before the patient agreed to participate. Ten patients were invited to participate, of which all consented and agreed to participate. This research was exempt from review by an institutional review board or ethical authority under Danish law. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants. In the interview, the patients first filled in the questionnaire on their own and were asked to mark questions they found difficult or problematic. According to the topic guide for the interviews, the interviewer discussed each marked item on the questionnaire asking participants whether the translated item was: 1) difficult to answer; 2) confusing; 3) difficult to understand; or 4) upsetting/offensive. Participants were additionally asked how they would phrase the question in their own words. If a participant had any comments on the translated item, they were asked to rephrase the question in a way that would be less confusing, more easily understood, and/or less upsetting or offensive. The interviewer additionally asked the patients about their general thoughts related to answering the questions and what problems they had experienced in order to identify the reasoning behind their comments. The interviewer kept notes throughout the interview, summarized and repeated their notes for the patient before closing the interview. The steering group reviewed the results of all interviews, and made decisions based on all questions identified as problematic by participants. Data analysis was performed according to the procedures used in the translation manual from the EORTC Quality of Life Group [ 15 ]. The steering committee compiled a summary of participant comments from pilot testing interviews. All items that elicited comments from participants were examined to determine the nature of the problem, and what suggestions were made for alternate phrasing. This report was then sent to the EORTC Quality of Life Group, and results were discussed both within the steering committee, and then with the EORTC Quality of Life Group. If changes were determined necessary, further re-testing would be performed. The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. This research was exempt from review by an institutional review board or ethical authority under Danish law. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study."

If a participant had any comments on the translated item, they were asked to rephrase the question in a way that would be less confusing, more easily understood, and/or less upsetting or offensive. The interviewer additionally asked the patients about their general thoughts related to answering the questions and what problems they had experienced in order to identify the reasoning behind their comments. The interviewer kept notes throughout the interview, summarized and repeated their notes for the patient before closing the interview."

        "content": "The forward translation was performed by two native Danes with academic experience in translation of English texts with the Danish Cancer Society. In eight items full agreement was found in translation between both translators. In 16 items, minor differences were found in word choice, but there was no difference found in meaning. In 2 items, different words were utilized to describe symptom with slight alteration in interpretation, which were discussed to determine the most accurate statement in reconciliation with the English text. The following decisions were made: in item 39, ‘…the medical treatment…?’ was chosen to be utilized over ‘…the doctor’s treatment…?’, and in the introductory text ‘Patients sometimes report…’ was chosen to be utilized over ‘Patients sometimes tell…’. The backwards translation was performed by two bilingual native English speakers, one originating from the USA and the other from the UK. Both have experience in translation of Danish texts with the Danish Cancer Society. In 10 items there was full agreement in translation between the two translations and in accordance with the original English text. In 15 items there were minor differences in word choice with no difference in meaning in comparison to the original English text. In one item, the backward translation resulted in a different meaning in comparison to the original English text. The backward translation item 24, ‘to what extent was sex enjoyable for you,’ resulted in ‘..was sex pleasant ..’ and ‘.. was sex comfortable ..’. This was considered not to reflect the original meaning. The exact Danish word for ‘enjoyable’ was chosen from one of the forward translations and changed in the question item. This was the only change made to the original Danish text, and no further changes were determined to be required from the translators. Pilot test interviews lasted between 15 and 20 min each. Patients were between the ages of 20 and 56 with an average age of 41. Participant demographics are summarized in Table  1 . Table 1 Characteristics of patients Age Education Civil status 56 Skilled worker Married/couple 38 Higher education (3–4 years) Single 42 Higher education (3–4 years) Married/couple 20 Student Single 52 Higher education (> = 5 years) Married/couple 52 Skilled worker Single 24 Higher education (3–4 years) Single (girlfriend) 46 Higher education (3–4 years) Married/couple 48 Higher education (3–4 years) Married/couple 35 Primary school Single Characteristics of patients Interviews elicited 11 total comments on 8 different EORTC-TC26 questions by five distinct patients (50% of participants). Comments could be applied to multiple statement categories. Four comments were difficulties in understanding, six were confusing statements, and four were suggestions for alterations in wording. One statement requested clarification in time dimensions within the EORTC questionnaire as a whole. Table  2  summarizes the comments for each question and patient. There were no comments related to difficult words or upsetting questions. Table 2 Comments obtained for each question and patient Question nr. Difficulty understanding Confusing Suggested wording 31  A little confusing as you can lose hair as a man regardless connection to cancer Have you lost hair in relation to your treatment? 32  Is it only interesting if it is experienced as a problem? What if you experience a change but not think of it as a problem 38  A little confusing only to ask about hearing badly, what about tinnitus – it is important – but will it be covered by this question? 39 Wording of the time dimension. Shall it be understood for the past or the present time? 40 (As in question 39) 42 (As in question 39) 45 Difficult to understand what the question is about The word ‘disruption’ seems wrong.

Other Comments Is it relevant to relate answers to the time dimension” in the past week” and the grammatically framing of the time dimension in the questions? Comments obtained for each question and patient The steering group discussed the results from the 10 interviews and determined that no changes were required after discussion. Hair loss and problems with taste or sense of smell were discussed as items that could be either determined as unproblematic or unrelated to cancer treatment. Discussion between the steering group determined that changes in description would change the inherent meaning of these statements, and that patients will generally complete this questionnaire within the context of cancer treatment and not external causes. Tinnitus was mentioned as a symptom that may not adequately be covered, however, the steering group believed it was well-covered under the questionnaire item ‘problems with hearing’. Lastly, the word ‘disruption’ was discussed as a potentially inappropriate word choice, however, no other Danish word was available that could correctly be translated backwards. All justifications are summarized in Table  3 . The final Danish translation has since been submitted to the EORTC Quality of Life Group. Table 3 Concerns and discussion from steering group justifying changing or retaining current translation in question Question Nr. / Topic Concern Discussion Question 31 - Hair Loss Men may lose hair for reasons not attributable to cancer. Although the comment is understandable, it is of no significance for the question. Generally, the patient shall not consider the reason for the symptom.  \n No change is required. Question 32 - Problems with Taste or Sense of Smell Problems with taste or sense of smell may be noted as changes that are not necessarily problematic. The patient’s reflection on the symptom being a problem or not can be relevant. However, changing the word would lead to an incorrect meaning when compared to the original English text.  \n No change is required. Question 38 - Tinnitus Problems with hearing may not adequately cover tinnitus. We consider that ‘tinnitus’ would be captured in the question of ‘problems with hearing’ as most patients would consider it a problem.  \n No change is required. Questions 39, 40, 42, 49, 50 - Time Dimension It is unclear if the statements are worded in past or present tense. Two of the patients commented on the different wordings of the time ‘were you …’ or ‘have you been …’. Also, there was consideration if satisfaction with the medical care should be related to the past or the present time.  We have decided not to make any change in the wording, as the shifts in wording follow the original English text.  \n No change is required. Question 45 - Disruption Affect may be a more appropriate word choice than disruption. Two patients commented on the wording of the question especially concerning the word ‘disruption’ and one suggested to use ‘affect’ instead. However, ‘affect’ would not be translated backwards to ‘disruption’. We have no other Danish word that would match ‘disruption’ translated as ‘forstyrrelse’ which was correctly translated backwards.  \n No change is required.

The end result translation was consistent with the EORTC-TC26 English language version. This pilot testing of the Danish translation of EORTC QLQ-CT26 was performed in one round of patient interviews with no changes required in the questionnaire’s wording. The EORTC QLQ-TC26 Danish translation is now available for use in cancer clinical trials through collaborative agreements with the EORTC Quality of Life Group. Strengths of this translation and pilot test include utilization of the official translation procedure for an EORTC instrument [ 10 ,  15 ]. While a small population ( n  = 10) was identified from a single site, the criteria have been met for an official standardized EORTC translation pilot test [ 15 ]. This pilot testing protocol is limited as interviews were not recorded and transcribed verbatim. However, the interviewer completed thorough notes, and repeated the contents of these notes to participants, ensuring accuracy of interview content and meaning throughout the pilot testing process. There has been prior commentary about the limitations of the EORTC QLQ-TC26 as a new instrument [ 4 ], however, with more time and sufficient use, the EORTC QLQ-TC26 will be better able to be assessed for utility in testicular-cancer specific QoL measurement. Phase IV field testing for the EORTC QLQ-TC26 is currently underway to assess for dimensionality, reliability, sensitivity to change and instrument validity [ 10 ]."

    "abstract": "A standard curative intent approach of chemotherapy treatment for metastatic testicular cancer has been well established. However, there is little guidance for patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) who require chemotherapy for this disease. Thus, we describe our treatment approach and rationale for a patient on HD with poor risk metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumor involving the testicle, lymph nodes, liver, and bone. After orchiectomy, five cycles of cisplatin and modified dose etoposide were delivered and strategically timed with HD. Treatment was complicated by significant neuropathy. Surgical resection of two liver lesions was performed after chemotherapy. Ten years post-chemotherapy, he remains free of clinical, biochemical, or radiological recurrence. While our patient remains free of disease after this treatment, the optimal chemotherapy and dialysis dose and schedule to maximize cure and minimize toxicity remains unknown.",

The standard chemotherapy for treatment of poor risk patients is four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) or etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP) [ 1 ]. For testicular cancer patients with renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (HD), the optimal delivery and efficacy of chemotherapy is a rare and challenging clinical scenario. We present a case of a patient with poor risk nonseminomatous germ cell tumour in the setting of chronic renal failure who was being worked up for a renal transplant. Very little literature has been published on the safe and effective delivery of chemotherapy in this subset of patients; thus, this case report provides an important addition to medical literature."

        "content": "A 30-year-old patient awaiting a living-related donor renal transplant for chronic renal failure (creatinine 571 umol/L) related to reflux nephropathy presented to the local emergency room with right upper quadrant pain. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated liver function tests with hepatomegaly on abdominal ultrasound and multiple hepatic masses suspicious for metastasis. Subsequent computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis confirmed multifocal hepatic lesions ( Figure 1 ), periportal lymph nodes, a 4-mm nonspecific left lower lobe lung lesion, sclerotic lesions of the ribs, and a large mass in the left scrotum consistent with a testicular cancer ( Figure 2 ). Bone scan also demonstrated sclerotic lesions in the seventh thoracic vertebrae, sternum, and the left iliac bone. Physical exam confirmed a large right testicular mass. His alpha fetal protein (AFP) was 62,777 umol/L (normal < 10), Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (B-HCG) was 32 IU/L (normal < 1), and the lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) was 367 U/L (normal < 192). Orchiectomy was performed the following day and revealed a diffuse 16 × 8 × 6.5 cm multi-lobulated variegated tumor mass with multifocal areas of necrosis and cystic components with no normal testicular parenchyma seen. Microscopic exam displayed predominantly immature teratoma with foci of yolk sac tumor involving the tunica vaginalis and spermatic cord. To summarize, he had a T3N0M1bS3 tumor and thus was poor risk based on the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group criteria [ 2 ]. At this point, the patient had not yet required dialysis for his significant renal dysfunction. The patient was started on chemotherapy as an inpatient consisting of full dose Cisplatin 20 mg/m 2  and Etoposide 60 mg/m 2  (60% dose) days 1 to 5 every 21 days. It was clear that to deliver cisplatin-based chemotherapy safely, he would need to go on HD. He was hemodialyzed one hour post-chemotherapy for days 1 to 6 for cycle 1 and days 1 to 5 for subsequent cycles. Daily G-CSF 480 mcg was administered after each cycle subcutaneously starting 24 h after chemotherapy for a total of 10 days. He was hemodialyzed three times per week when not receiving chemotherapy. He did not receive bleomycin. Despite G-CSF, he developed febrile neutropenia on cycle 1 day 10. The absolute neutrophil count remained <1.0 × 10 9 /L for 5 days, and his urine cultures were positive. The dose of etoposide was therefore not increased for subsequent cycles as planned. After four cycles of chemotherapy, he had grade 2 anorexia, weight loss (16%), and grade 1 sensory neuropathy. Tumor marker levels declined during chemotherapy, and after four cycles, his AFP, B-HCG, and LDH levels were normal. Given the dose reduction in etoposide during cycles 1 to 4 (total dose of 1200 mg instead of 2000 mg) and omission of bleomycin and ifosfamide, it was decided to proceed with a fifth cycle of chemotherapy. His neuropathy worsened (grade 2) after the fifth cycle, and no further chemotherapy was given. Three months after chemotherapy terminated, he had developed grade 3 neuropathy, both sensory and motor, primarily affecting his upper extremities. Functionally, he had significant impairment and required assistance in activities of daily living such as dressing, eating, bathing, and mobilizing. Electromyography studies showed a diffuse peripheral sensory neuropathy with mild motor involvement. Nineteen months from diagnosis, the largest liver lesion demonstrated growth on imaging; however, tumor markers remained normal ( Figure 3 ). Resection of this large lesion in segment 7, as well as a wedge resection of a smaller lesion in segment 8, was performed. Pathology revealed mature teratoma in both the 5.5 cm and 0.8 cm lesions. His neuropathy gradually improved over the years; however, he still requires a walker for longer distances and an electric wheelchair during the icy winter months. He continues to require assistance with fine motor skills such as buttoning, tying laces, and zippers. He has not been able to work since his testicular cancer diagnosis due his dialysis schedule and the neuropathy. Ten years after finishing chemotherapy, he remains in follow up, with no evidence of clinical, biochemical, or radiologic recurrence. The bone lesions regressed over time. He remains on regular HD and has opted not to proceed with a kidney transplant."

        "content": "The metabolism of many chemotherapeutic agents is dependent on adequate renal function, which makes management challenging for patients with significant renal dysfunction requiring HD. The literature on optimally prescribing cytotoxic drugs in patients on HD is scant and often conflicting. Cisplatin is predominantly (90%) eliminated by the kidneys and present in both plasma-bound and free forms, with the free form being dialyzable. In general, dose reductions are recommended in addition to timing treatment immediately after HD sessions or on non-dialysis days [ 3 , 4 ]. Etoposide is partially (40–60%) excreted by the kidneys and is not removed by HD; dose reduction and treatment either before or after HD are recommended [ 4 ]. Additionally, successful dose escalation of cisplatin and etoposide administration with HD post infusion in lung cancer patients has been described [ 5 ]. In testicular cancer, however, the goal is cure, and any dose delays or reductions may impact cure rates. Due to the rare clinical situation in which one must deliver chemotherapy to testicular cancer patients on or requiring HD, there is no established published approach. On a review of the literature at the time of planning treatment for our patient, one case report was found that described a patient with advanced nonseminomatous germ cell tumour on chronic HD with a known seizure history [ 6 ]. Cycle 1 consisted of cisplatin 50% dose and etoposide 60% dose with hemodialysis 1 h after infusion. Cycle 2 consisted of cisplatin and etoposide at full dose. With cycle 3, an ifosfamide 100% dose was added, but the patient developed pneumonia and bacteremia, requiring admission to Intensive Care. Although delayed, the fourth cycle consisted of cisplatin and etoposide at 100% dose and ifosfamide at 75% dose. The patient had recurrent seizures on day two of cycle 4 and another admission to the Intensive Care Unit; thus, no further ifosfamide was given. Since treating our patient, two other English language case reports have been published. One documents a 28-year-old man with good risk nonseminomatous testicular cancer on HD treated with cisplatin 50% dose and etoposide 60% dose with HD every second day for cycle 1; however, the timing of HD is not described. The patient had anemia and thrombocytopenia [ 3 ]. Two subsequent cycles were given at full dose with daily HD during chemotherapy and G-CSF support. Post cycle 2, he developed thrombocytopenia, and post cycle 3, he developed pancytopenia but no clinical complications. He had a complete response. A second report documents a 31-year-old with end stage renal disease and a primary mediastinal yolk sac tumor. He was operated on first and then treated with cisplatin 50% dose and etoposide 60% dose with daily HD starting 1 h after chemotherapy and G-CSF support [ 7 ]. After the first cycle, he developed grade 4 neutropenia and appendicitis. Cycle 2 was given at the same dose with no complications, and thu, cycles 3–5 were given with cisplatin and etoposide 75% dose. He did develop significant pancytopenia but no further clinical complications. He had no cancer recurrence after one year. Cisplatin pharmacokinetic studies were available with cycles 3 and 4 which showed higher maximum drug concentrations and area under the curve despite dose reductions compared to expected pharmacokinetics in a patient with normal renal function. No excess non-hematological toxicities were reported in either of these case reports. Despite guidelines and data supporting the use of three chemotherapy drugs in poor prognosis patients, neither bleomycin nor ifosfamide were used in our case. Bleomycin is predominantly cleared by the kidneys, is effectively not dialyzed, and can have life-threatening pulmonary toxicities, and thus it was felt to be too high risk to use in this situation [ 8 ]. Ifosfamide can be nephrotoxic but has been shown to be at least partially dialyzable [ 9 ]. If our patient had done well with cycle one, the plan had been to increase the etoposide dose first and then potentially add ifosfamide. This plan was abandoned due to the neutropenic complications seen after the first cycle despite G-CSF. While five cycles of dose reduced chemotherapy produced a successful oncologic outcome, our patient suffered life altering long-term complications from sensory and motor neuropathy. Given he had grade 1 neuropathy after his fourth cycle, the fifth cycle of chemotherapy undoubtedly contributed to his morbidity. Patients with metastatic testicular cancer on HD can be successfully treated with cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy, although the optimal dose and schedule of the chemotherapy and HD remains unknown. Limited and conflicting data on chemotherapy drug concentrations, clearance, and availability in these situations make it difficult to make decisions on dose escalation or drug continuation. Should patients develop non-hematological toxicities during chemotherapy, one needs to weigh the risk–benefit ratio carefully between the risk of long-term complications and the potential impact on cure. This case report represents a significant contribution to the current literature on the safe delivery and efficacy for testicular cancer patients undergoing curative chemotherapy on HD, a topic for which further knowledge is imperative to guide future clinicians and establish future guidelines for this rare clinical scenario."

    "abstract": "Abstract Backgrounds Testicular cancer is the most common malignancy in young men. Considering increasing incidence, exceptionally high cure rate, as well as long life expectancy, assessment of long term toxicity in testicular cancer survivors is of great importance. In the last decades a major effort has been made in order to reduce toxicity of treatment, while maintaining its high effectiveness. Conclusions Actual knowledge on treatment toxicity is based on outdated treatment modalities. Hopefully, modern treatment modalities could reduce toxicity, but, there is no firm confirmation for that at the moment, as data dealing with late sequelae of modern treatment of testicular cancer are not available yet due to the short period of observation. The life-threatening cardiovascular toxicity in testicular cancer survivors is major complication of platinum-based chemotherapy, mediastinal radiotherapy and even subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy.",

Considering increasing incidence worldwide 1 - 3 , exceptionally high cure rate with 5-year survival rate exceeding 95% for all stages 4  and life expectancy almost comparable to age-matched healthy male population 5 , evaluation of treatment-related long-term morbidity has become increasingly important. In the past decades efforts have been made in order to optimize treatment with objective to decrease toxicity, while maintaining high cure rates. The introduction of less toxic chemotherapeutic schemes 6 - 8 , reduction in radiation doses and volumes 9 - 11  and preferred use of active surveillance 12 , have all led to reduced treatment toxicity. Irrespective of that, some treatment-related sequelae remained unavoidable. Most of the current studies represent complications of treatment modalities administered several years or even decades ago, but are still of a major concern. With the 25-year risk of approximately 16%, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are among the most important life-threatening long-term complications in testicular cancer survivors. 13  Long-term testicular cancer survivors are more likely to develop unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile. 14 - 21  In addition, an increased risk of mortality caused by CVD has also been observed. 5 , 22 - 24 According to the current knowledge, cardiovascular toxicity is mainly due to cisplatin based chemotherapy and mediastinal radiation therapy 13 , 19 , 25 ; although subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy is associated with an increased risk of CVD as well. 14 , 26"

        "content": "The introduction of cisplatin based chemotherapeutic regimens into treatment of testicular cancer in the early 1970s represents cornerstone in testicular cancer management. Prior to that, different chemotherapeutic regimens were used, some of them containing even anthracyclines, cytotoxic drugs with well known cardiotoxic effect. Although reports on cisplatin cardiovascular toxicity date back to the 1980s 20 , 27 - 29 , first study systematically reporting the frequency of late cardiac morbidity by Meinardi  et al . was published in 2000. After a median follow up of 14 years, a major cardiac event was documented in 5 of 87 patients (5.8%) treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy; myocardial infarction in 2 (2.3%) and angina pectoris in the remaining 3 (3.5%) patients. Compared with the general male population, this corresponded to approximately 7-fold increased risk (observed-to-expected ratio [O/E] = 7.1, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9 to 18.3-fold). In this study, additional analysis of subclinical cardiac disease was performed as well. Echocardiographic evaluation showed abnormal diastolic function of the left ventricle in 33% of the patients treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy, probably as an early sign of microvasculopathy. 19 Subsequent studies with larger testicular cancer cohorts in following years revealed the magnitude of the problem ( Table 1 ). Huddart  et al . reported on cardiovascular morbidity in 992 testicular cancer survivors, treated between 1982 and 1992 at the Royal Marsden Health Service Trust. In particular, they reported on cardiac events, comprising angina pectoris, long-term chest pain, myocardial infarction, surgery for coronary artery disease and others cardiac abnormalities. Approximately two thirds of the patients were treated with chemotherapy; cisplatin-based in two thirds and carboplatin-based in remaining third. After a median follow up of 10.2 years, age-adjusted relative risk (RR) for cardiac events was 2.59 (95% CI, 1.15 to 5.84) with no significant difference between patients treated with cisplatin and those treated with carboplatin. There was no difference in risk for cardiac events between patients treated with bleomycin containing regimens and those, who didn’t get bleomycin, indicating that bleomycin did not significantly contribute to cardiac damage. Moreover, in this study, risk for cardiac events was increased in patients treated with radiotherapy (RR = 2.4, 95% CI, 1.04 to 5.45), although a minority of them - only 8.3%, received mediastinal radiotherapy. Patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy were, as expected, at the highest risk, with age-adjusted RR = 2.78 (95% CI, 1.09 to 7.07). 26 Risk for coronary artery disease in testicular cancer survivors regarding to different treatment modalities BEP = bleomycin, etoposid, cisplatin; CAD = coronary artery disease; ChT = chemotherapy; CVB = cisplatin, etoposid, bleomycin; HR = hazard ratio; med. = mediastinal; N = number of patients; n.r. = not reported; RT =radiotherapy; RR = relative risk; SIR = standardized incidence ratio; subdia. = subdiaphragmatic; All patients treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy before 1987. Age for seminoma patients. Age for nonseminoma patients. After a median follow up of 18.4 years, van der Belt-Dusebout  et al . reported on 694 cardiovascular events in 2 512 5-year testicular cancer survivors. The overall standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for coronary artery disease was significantly elevated (SIR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.31). They found slightly, but not significantly increased risk for coronary artery disease in chemotherapy treated patients compared to the general population (SIR = 1.35, 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.83). Chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, bleomycin (PVB) regimen was associated with 1.9-fold (95% CI, 1.7 to 2.0-fold), significantly increased risk for myocardial infarction, while chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin (BEP) was associated with borderline significantly increased risk for CVD (SIR = 1.5, 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.2), but not for myocardial infarction. Analysis of patients treated with radiotherapy revealed 3.7-fold (95% CI, 2.2 to 6.2-fold) increased risk for myocardial infarction after a mediastinal radiotherapy, while there was no increased risk for CVD after subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy. There was a trend towards higher risk for coronary artery disease with younger age at diagnosis and younger age at follow up as well, for the whole study group. In addition, in nonseminoma group of patients there was a significant influence of attained age of patient on the risk for myocardial infarction, with increased risk in 54 years old or younger (SIR = 1.86, 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.74), even higher risk in younger than 45 years (SIR = 2.06, 95% CI, 1.15 to 3.41) and decreased risk in 55 years or older (SIR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.98). 13 Haugnes  et al . recently reported on cardiovascular morbidity in 990 testicular cancer survivors treated between 1980 and 1994. The incidence of two end-points were evaluated: coronary artery disease, including myocardial infarction and angina pectoris and atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular insult, transitory ischemic attack, carotid stenosis and other peripheral atherosclerotic disease. With a median follow up of 19 years, testicular cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy had increased risk for coronary artery disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.6, 95% CI, 0.96 to 6.9) and atherosclerotic disease (HR = 2.6, 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.9), compared to surgery only group. Treatment with BEP was associated with a 5.7-fold (95% CI, 1.9 to 17.1-fold), significantly increased risk for coronary artery disease and a 4.7-fold (95% CI, 1.8 to 12.2-fold), significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic disease, while treatment with CVB was associated with nonsignificantly increased risk for CVD, in contrary with the results of van der Belt-Dusebout study. Additional subanalyses, taking into account chemotherapy type, revealed that higher cumulative dose of etoposide was associated with increased risk for coronary artery disease, while higher cumulative doses of etoposide and cisplatin were associated with increased risk for atherosclerotic disease as well. Interestingly, risk for coronary artery disease and atherosclerotic disease were increased even in patients treated with mostly non-mediastinal radiotherapy (only 3 of 420 irradiated patients received mediastinal radiotherapy), being 2.1-fold (95% CI, 0.78 to 5.4-fold) and 2.3-fold (95% CI, 1.03 to 5.3-fold), respectively. In accordance with results of other studies, treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy posed the highest risk, 5.3-fold (95% CI, 1.5 to 18.3-fold) for coronary artery disease and 4.7-fold (95% CI, 1.6 to 14.1-fold) for atherosclerotic disease, respectively. 14 Hanks  et al . reported on elevated cardiac mortality after 15-years follow up in 387 testicular cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy in 1973 and 1974. Seventy-nine percent of patients with stage II and 27% of patients with stage I had mediastinal irradiation. A significant, 3.1-fold increase in non-cancer mortality was observed compared to general male population. Further analysis of causes of death revealed a 2.3-fold increase in cardiac deaths. Eight out of ten patients, who died due to cardiac disease, received mediastinal irradiation. 22 In Zagars’ study only minority of patients (71 of 477) received mediastinal irradiation. The cardiac mortality rate was significantly elevated only beyond 15 years of follow-up with standardized mortality ratio (SMR) 1.95 (95% CI, 1.24 to 2.94). Cardiac mortality rate was not significantly elevated during the first 15 years of follow up for the whole group of patients, except for the subgroup of patients treated with mediastinal irradiation (SMR = 1.63, 95% CI, 0.44 to 4.17). 23 Fossa  et al . was the first author reporting on cardiac mortality among testicular cancer survivors treated with combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. They found slightly, but significantly increased risk of dying from circulatory disease (SMR = 1.20, 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.5). A comparison according to the diagnostic periods failed to show increase of mortality after the introduction of cisplatin, probably due to other treatment modifications that happened in that period: omission of mediastinal irradiation, confinement of subdiaphragmatic fields and introduction of modern radiotherapy planning and delivery facilities. 24 In another large international study by Fossa  et al ., there was no significant increase in overall mortality from circulatory disease in whole study population of 38 907 patients treated for testicular cancer with only surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy or with combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, a significantly increased mortality due to hypertensive disorder (SMR = 1.39, 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.89) was documented. Mortality caused by all circulatory diseases was significantly higher in testicular cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy (SMR = 1.44, 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.91) compared to group of patients treated with radiotherapy or surgery only. The risk was even higher in testicular cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (SMR = 2.06, 95% CI, 1.27 to 3.14). In comparision with the general population, mortality from circulatory disease was significantly increased in patients treated with radiotherapy at the age under 35 years (SMR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.31), as well as in patients treated with chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy) at the age under 35 years after 1975 (SMR = 1.58, 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.01). The latter coincides with introduction of cisplatin based chemotherapy. 5 Although mechanisms that would explain an increased risk of CVD after cisplatin based chemotherapy are not completely clarified, endothelial damage is considered to play a main role in pathogenesis. Microalbuminuria, thought to be an early sign of endothelial damage, was reported by Meinardi  et al . in 22% of patients treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy. 19  Patients with micro-albuminuria had a tendency of higher blood pressure, which could be a consequence of systemic endothelial damage as well. 30  Moreover, microalbuminuria was shown to be a predictor of cardiac events. 31 , 32  Nuver  et al . observed microalbuminuria in 12% of patients treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy for testicular cancer after median follow up of 7 years, compared to 0% in surgery only group and 4.6% in a larger group of healthy men from general population. 33 Nuver  et al . proposed other endothelial and inflammatory markers as potential early indicators of endothelial damage and atherosclerosis, which is essentially an inflammatory proces. 33  Namely, they found significantly higher levels of von Willebrandt factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), fibrinogen and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in patients treated with chemotherapy compared to healthy men. Elevated levels of endothelial and inflammatory markers were shown to be associated with higher risk for coronary artery disease. 34 , 35  In addition, elevated levels of inflammatory proteins were associated with more pronounced atherosclerosis as well. 36  Moreover, according to the available data from the literature, hs-CRP could be a predictive marker for CVD. 36 - 39  In the same study by Nuver  et al . evaluation of vascular structure and function of common carotid artery was performed. Irrespective of high levels of endothelial and inflammatory markers, this evaluation failed to show any significant changes in wall structure or function of blood vessel, except a small, but statistically significant increase in carotid wall stiffness. Explanation for this could be impairment of microvasculature at the early stages, with later impairment of the macrovasculature. The same author in another study also reported on small, but statistically significant increase in carotid intima media thickness in patients treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy, which was shown to be associated with higher myocardial infarction incidence. 40 Gietema  et al . showed a presence of circulating platinum in plasma up to 20 years after treatment with cisplatin based chemotherapy in testicular cancer survivors, which, together with the awareness of signs for endothelial damage, led to the theory that cisplatin may chronically stimulate the endothelium, eventually resulting in vasculature impairment. 41 , 42  Correlation between cisplatin plasma levels and severity of neurotoxicity was recently shown, indicating that cisplatin level may serve as a putative marker for long-term toxicity, perhaps even for CVD. 43 CVD following cisplatin based chemotherapy could, on the other hand, be caused by a gradual development of unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile. Namely, several studies reported significantly higher prevalence of hypertension in testicular cancer survivors treated with platinum based chemotherapy. 14 , 16 , 19  Another cause of hypertension in testicular cancer survivors could be abdominal radiotherapy. Namely, some studies with patients treated with abdominal radiotherapy for malignant disease in abdomen reported on increased risk of hypertension. Possible explanation for this is development of radiation nephropathy with resulting hypertension, probably through a renovascular mechanism with activation of the reninangiotensin-aldosteron system. 44 - 46  Furthermore, a few studies reported on increased risk for hypercholesterolemia, as well as increased prevalence of obesity following cisplatin based chemotherapy in testicular cancer survivors, which was, on the other hand, not confirmed by others. 14 - 19 , 21  Haugnes  et al . found significantly higher levels of HbA1c in all chemotherapy and radiotherapy treated testicular cancer patients compared to surgery only group, moreover, patients treated with radiotherapy were at a greater risk of being diagnosed with diabetes as well. Namely, the prevalence of diabetes for the whole study group was 7.3%, while it was 10.2% and 15.6% for radiotherapy and radiotherapy/chemotherapy group, respectively. The most likely explanation for this is radiation damage of pancreatic gland tissue, as the large part of the gland is included in subdiaphragmatic radiation field. Insulin resistance in testicular cancer patients treated with chemotherapy could be a consequence of persistent hypomagnesemia, caused by cisplatininduced damage of proximal renal tubules. In Haugnes´ study it was found that the prevalence of other unfavourable risk factors for CVD was the highest in radiotherapy/chemotherapy group as well, suggesting a possibility of synergistic effect. 14 Hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity and insulin resistance are all components of the metabolic syndrome. Considering that testicular cancer survivors are at greater risk to have one or more of these components, the metabolic syndrome could be a possible causal link between cytotoxic treatment and CVD. 47 , 48  The prevalence rates of metabolic syndrome in testicular cancer survivors range from 8% to 40%, depending on applied criteria for diagnosis of this syndrome. Patients treated with chemotherapy are at higher risk for development of metabolic syndrome, compared to controls and to radiotherapy or surgery only group. This is especially true for patients receiving higher cumulative dose of cisplatin – 850 mg or more. Beside association with cumulative dose of cisplatin, a positively correlation was demonstrated between prevalence of metabolic syndrome and cumulative doses of bleomycin and etoposide as well. 48  The aetiology of the metabolic syndrome is not entirely clear. Gietema  et al . were the first authors reporting on the possible association of metabolic syndrome with low serum testosterone levels in patients who received chemotherapy. 49  Nuver  et al . proposed that low serum testosterone level and metabolic syndrome could be associated through increased body mass index. 48 It’s well known that hypogonadism increases risk for CVD and correlates with the severity of atherosclerosis, even in a healthy male population. In addition, it was shown that gonadal dysfunction is associated with obesity, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance, as well as with higher levels of markers of endothelial damage. A middle aged men from general population with free testosterone levels in the lower third of normal range were at a 2.7-fold (95% CI, 2.0 to 3.7-fold) increased risk for metabolic syndrome in age-adjusted analyses. After further adjusting for body mass index, low free testosterone level was associated with 1.7-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.4-fold) increased risk for metabolic syndrome. This correlation was even more pronounced for total testosterone levels and sex-hormone binding globulin levels. 50  In testicular cancer survivors, gonadal dysfunction may be result of prior treatment with chemotherapy, subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy and with surgery as well. 51 However, it is still ongoing debate, whether metabolic syndrome is a consequence of hypogonadism or intrinsic feature of testicular cancer survivors, as a part of testicular dysgenesis syndrome. If the first assumption is true, the testosterone substitution therapy could have a favourable impact on metabolic syndrome and development of CVD in testicular cancer survivors. To date, there is no evidence for that. According to the literature, substitution therapy with testosterone might be useful in men with significantly reduced testosterone levels, while its benefit is questionable in a case of modest hypogonadism. 48 Increased risk for CVD after mediastinal radiotherapy in patients treated for testicular cancer is a consequence of a direct exposure of the heart to irradiation. 52 - 54  Data from the literature indicate that irradiation of the heart leads to the tissue damage through microvasculopathy and eventually macrovasculopathy. Endothelial damage of small blood vessels is due to radiation induced generation of reactive oxygen species. Typically, irregularities of the endothelial cell membranes, cytoplasmic swelling, thrombosis and rupture of the walls are present in early phase. This eventually results in reduced ratio of capillaries to myocytes by approximately 50%, leading to ischaemia and fibrosis in late phase. 55 Less is known about pathologic association between subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy and CVD. According to the physical model, in series of Huddart  et al ., the expected mean dose to the heart in a case of “dog leg” radiation field, extending upwards to the bottom of tenth thoracic vertebra, was approximately 2.5% of the total dose, which is unlikely to cause any serious damage. 26  Possible mechanism of CVD in patients treated with abdominal radiotherapy could be radiation nephropathy, as well as hypogonadism, as mentioned above. A direct endothelial damage, eventually resulting in atherosclerosis, is another possible mechanism, supported by increased levels of hs-CRP in patients treated with radiotherapy. 56 Up to 1980's, total dose of subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy was 36 to 40 Gy and even more. After that, radiation dose was gradually reduced, being 20 Gy for stage I seminoma, 30 Gy for stage II A and 36 Gy for stage II B. In case of prophylactic mediastinal irradiation, testicular cancer survivors usually received 30 Gy. Fractionation, mainly used in subdiaphragmatic, as well as in mediastinal irradiation, is 2 Gy daily fractions 5 days per week. Current knowledge about long-term treatment-related toxicity in testicular cancer survivors is based on treatment modalities administered years to decades ago. Optimization of treatment, including omission of mediastinal irradiation, confinement of subdiaphragmatic fields, use of modern radiotherapy planning and delivery techniques, lowering the cumulative doses of cytotoxic drugs and preferential use of active surveillance will probably all reduce risk for cardiac toxicity. 7 - 12  However, as data from newer studies are not yet available, we do not have confirmation for this and further research is essential. 57 Following successful treatment, most of the testicular cancer survivors are under the medical surveillance of their oncologists for subsequent 5 to 10 years. Obviously, these patients need a longer, probably life-long follow-up with special attention to modifiable CVD risk factors. Patients should be treated for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and dyslipidaemia and advised about healthy lifestyle. A smoking cessation is highly recommended, along with regular physical activity and maintaining of optimal body weight. At the moment, no guidelines concerning CVD risk in testicular cancer survivors are available and several study groups proposed their development. 25"

    "abstract": "Testicular cancer (TC) represents the most common cancer affecting men within the reproductive age and is often accompanied by major disturbances in semen parameters. Cryopreservation is recommended in these patients before initiating cancer treatment. Currently, there are no studies reporting the molecular mechanisms associated with altered semen quality in these men. The main objective of this study was to compare the sperm proteome of normozoospermic (motility >40%) and asthenozoospermic (motility <40%) TC patients with normozoospermic infertile men without cancer (control group). Pooled sperm samples from normozoospermic ( n  = 20), asthenozoospermic ( n  = 11) TC, and a control group ( n  = 9) were used for quantitative global proteomic profiling using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 1085, 846, and 982 proteins were identified in normozoospermic TC, asthenozoospermic TC, and control groups, respectively. Functional analysis revealed mitochondrial dysfunction and altered cellular pathways in both normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients. Comparison of pathway analysis showed no significant difference in fertility-associated proteins/mechanism between the normozoospermic TC patients and infertile men. Western blot analysis revealed under-expression of NDUFS1 associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and overexpression of CD63 involved in sperm maturation in both normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients. Our proteomic results confirm that defective cellular pathways are associated with reproductive functions in both normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients before the start of cancer treatment.",

        "content": "Testicular cancers (TCs) are diagnosed in men with an average reproductive age of 33 years. In the United States alone, 9310 new cases of TC were reported in 2018 and its incidence has been steadily increasing [ 1 ]. Infertile men possess increased risk of encountering TC compared to men from the general population [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]. Testicular cancer is one of the most curable cancers with a survival rate of 95% [ 6 ]. However, the majority of men with TC are diagnosed as infertile even before initiating cancer treatment [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ]. Causes for infertility in these men include hormonal imbalance, intrinsic testicular damage, congenital abnormalities associated with testicular maturation, and spermatogenic failure [ 6 , 12 ]. The relationship between TC and impaired semen parameters before the onset of treatment is well established [ 13 , 14 ]. In general, a reduction in sperm concentration is seen in TC patients compared to other types of cancer [ 15 , 16 ]. In particular, asthenozoospermia (sperm motility < 40%) is prevalent in 30% to 45% of TC cases [ 15 , 17 , 18 ]. Several studies have reported sub-normal semen parameters and poor fertilization rates in men with TC [ 11 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ]. However, 50% of TC patients are found to have normal semen parameters (normozoospermia) according to WHO 2010 reference values [ 6 , 13 ]. The reason for infertility in these men with normal semen parameters is unclear. Unexplained male infertility is a multifactorial disorder and conventional semen analysis fails to explain the etiology of infertility in such cases [ 24 ]. Furthermore, asthenozoospermia is a common cause of male infertility and it is observed in 18% of infertile men [ 25 ] and accounts for up to 81% of all abnormal semen analyses [ 26 ]. Over the past decade, the proteomic platform has been used to study the changes in the protein profiles of spermatozoa [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ]. Advancement in sperm proteomic research has provided the molecular basis of unexplained infertility [ 31 ]. Several sperm proteomic studies on normozoospermic infertile men have reported changes at the subcellular level of spermatozoa [ 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 ]. These changes are associated with proteins related to sperm capacitation and acrosome reaction that are essential for the fertilization of oocyte [ 26 , 36 ]. The majority of TC patients are referred for sperm banking by their oncologists before the start of their cancer treatment. Fertility history in the majority of these patients is not established. In addition, they are not referred to a fertility specialist because of the urgency of oncological treatment. Therefore, to understand the possible underlying cause(s) of infertility in TC patients, we compared the sperm proteome of normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients with that of normozoospermic infertile men without cancer (control group)."

Sperm motility was significantly ( p  < 0.0001) decreased in asthenozoospermic TC patients ( Supplementary Materials Table S1 ). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detected a total of 1085, 846, and 982 proteins in normozoospermic TC, asthenozoospermic TC and control groups, respectively. Based on the normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) ratio and protein abundance, 168 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in normozoospermic TC and 347 in asthenozoospermic TC patients compared with the control group. The overexpressed and under-expressed DEPs, and unique proteins are shown in  Figure 1 . Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed phagosome maturation, sirtuin signaling pathway, mitochondrial dysfunction, atherosclerosis signaling, and remodeling of epithelial adherens junctions as the top five canonical pathways in normozoospermic TC patients ( Table 1 ). Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation, sirtuin signaling pathway, protein ubiquitination pathway, and phagosome maturation were identified as top canonical pathways in asthenozoosp ermic TC patients ( Table 1 ). Canonical pathways-related reproductive function and their significance in both normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients are shown in  Figure 2 . Upstream regulator analysis revealed rapamycin-insensitive companion of mammalian target of rapamycin (RICTOR) function was significantly activated in asthenozoospermic TC patients with a z-score of 4.59. No significant activation of RICTOR was seen in normozoospermic TC patients. Differentially expressed sperm proteins associated with RICTOR are shown in  Figure 3 . Functional analysis of DEPs identified the top pathways associated with disease and disorders, molecular and cellular functions in both normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC groups. Inflammatory response was identified as the top pathway in disease and disorders, and cellular compromise in molecular and cellular functions. However, the pathways associated with physiological system development and function were identified only in the asthenozoospermic TC patients ( Table 2 ). Forty DEPs were involved in reproductive system development pathway ( Table 2 ). Bioinformatic analysis identified the DEPs associated with sperm function and fertilization process that were altered in the asthenozoospermic TC patients ( Table 3 ). Network analysis revealed the involvement of sperm proteins in cellular assembly and organization, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, reproductive system development and function ( Figure 4 a), and cellular compromise, inflammatory response, and infectious diseases ( Figure 4 b). Of the four validated proteins CD63 antigen (CD63) was overexpressed and NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1 (NDUFS1) was under-expressed ( p  < 0.05) in both normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC groups ( Figure 5 a,b).

        "content": "Testicular cancer-associated male infertility is due to the side effect of aggressive oncology treatment [ 37 ]. Treatment options for TC such as radiation- and chemotherapy damages the gonads and results in impaired spermatogenesis process [ 12 , 38 , 39 ]. To improve the quality of life, fertility preservation is recommended in TC patients [ 40 ]. Sperm cryopreservation before treatment is a cost-effective strategy to establish a successful pregnancy [ 41 ]. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and define the patient’s pretreatment fertility and improve our understanding of the impact of TC and future fertilization potential in these men. Several studies have reported the successful use of cryopreserved sperm of TC patients for fathering a child [ 42 , 43 , 44 ]. Záková et al. [ 17 ] reported a pregnancy rate of 34.8% after using the cryopreserved sperm from TC patients. Similarly, conception rate was 30.4% in the men before diagnosis of TC [ 22 ]. Poor semen quality may be the possible reason for low pregnancy rate in these men. In TC patients, asthenozoospermia is well documented [ 11 , 45 ]. However, certain populations of TC patients also have normal semen parameters before treatment [ 46 ] and their fertility status remains questionable. In the current study, semen analysis results showed no significant difference in the sperm concentration and motility of normozoospermic TC patients prior to cancer treatment compared with the control group. Hence, it is important to understand the changes in the molecular mechanisms associated with sperm function in normozoospermic TC men utilizing the proteomic approach. The sperm proteome is highly complex and requires high throughput instruments such as LC-MS/MS to detect the maximum number of peptides and proteins [ 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 ]. In the current experiment, we also used LC-MS/MS to profile sperm proteins in TC patients and the control group. Until now, the majority of the sperm proteomic studies have been carried out on asthenozoospermic [ 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 ] or normozoospermic infertile men [ 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 ]. However, no reports are available on the proteomic changes associated with spermatozoa in normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients. Hence, comparing the proteome profiles of normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients with normozoospermic infertile men (control group) may provide an insight into the subcellular changes responsible for male infertility in these patients before initiating cancer treatment. Our proteomic results revealed fewer number of DEPs in spermatozoa of asthenozoospermic TC patients and the majority of the identified DEPs were either under-expressed or absent. This finding suggests that certain biological pathways are dysregulated in the spermatozoa, thus affecting sperm cell homeostasis in asthenozoospermic TC patients. Progression of TC impairs the spermatogenesis process [ 12 ]. Any defects during the sperm formation may also contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrion is the power house of sperm and its proper functioning is crucial for motility, hyperactivation, capacitation, acrosome reaction, and fertilization of spermatozoa [ 57 ]. Bracke et al. [ 26 ] and Cao et al. [ 58 ] reviewed sperm proteomic studies and reported that energy metabolism was dysfunctional in asthenozoospermic men. In asthenozoospermic TC patients in the current study, we noted that mitochondrial dysfunction was the top canonical pathway affected followed by oxidative phosphorylation ( Table 1 ). Even though the dysfunctional mitochondrial pathway was also noted to be affected in the normozoospermic TC patients, the dysregulation was comparatively more pronounced in the asthenozoospermic TC patients ( Figure 2 ). Validation of the under-expressed mitochondrial protein NDUFS1 using Western blot supports our proteomic findings. This inner mitochondrial membrane protein is involved in the transfer of electrons in the oxidative phosphorylation process. Under-expression of NDUFS1 suggests of mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, NDUFS1 is under the regulation of the RICTOR signaling pathway which regulates the spermatogenesis process and helps in the maintenance of the blood–testis barrier [ 59 , 60 ]. Upstream regulator analysis predicted the activation state of RICTOR in asthenozoospermic TC patients ( Figure 3 ). Hence, activation of RICTOR and under-expression of NDUFS1 implicates spermatogenic failure and mitochondrial dysfunction in asthenozoospermic TC patients. However, under-expression of NDUFS1 without activation of RICTOR is suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction without compromising sperm motility in normozoospermic TC patients. The functionality of spermatozoa is regulated by the molecular pathways associated with cellular functions. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed that the cellular compromised pathway was affected in both normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients ( Table 2 ). Siva et al. reported [ 61 ] the pathways compromising sperm functions such as stress response and sperm maturity were dysregulated in asthenozoospermic males. Proteins involved in vesicular trafficking were also found to be deregulated in asthenozoospermic men [ 52 ]. Our proteomic results identified proteins interacting with each other in the cellular compromise network ( Figure 4 b) were altered in asthenozoospermic TC patients. Validation of CD63 protein identified in the network further strengthens our bioinformatic results. Furthermore, CD63 is an exosomal marker protein [ 62 ] and is involved in the cellular molecule trafficking [ 63 ]. In general, spermatozoa fuse with the epididymosomes (exosomes) during its epididymal transit and undergoes maturation [ 64 ]. Aberrant expression of CD63 may affect the vesicle fusion and result in the production of immature spermatozoa. In the present study, using the Western blot technique we demonstrated the overexpression of CD63 in normozoospermic as well as asthenozoospermic TC patients ( Figure 5 ). This finding suggests that the sperm maturation process is defective in TC patients. A deep insight into the proteins related to the fertilization process provides a better understanding about the fertilization potential of spermatozoa. We identified the proteins involved in the reproductive system and developmental functions that were dysregulated in asthenozoospermic TC patients. Chaperonin protein CCT3 involved in sperm–egg and sperm–zona pellucida binding was detected in the network ( Figure 4 b) [ 65 ]. Under-expression of CCT3 in asthenozoospermic TC patients indicates a compromised fertilization process. Serpin family protein SERPINA5 is implicated in the fertilization process, as it inhibits the binding and penetration of sperm [ 66 ] and plays a prominent role in male infertility [ 67 ]. Our proteomic results showed overexpression of SERPINA5 in asthenozoospermic TC patients ( Table 3 ). However, Western blot validation of CCT3 and SERPINA5 did not show significant difference in the expression pattern among TC patients and control group. These discrepancies may be due to the reduced specificity and sensitivity of the conventional Western blot technique compared to robust LC-MS/MS technique. Our proteomic findings suggest that even though normozoospermic TC patients exhibit normal semen parameters, sperm proteins associated with the fertilization process are dysregulated in these men. To our knowledge, this is the first proteomic study to investigate the molecular pathways associated with altered reproductive functions in normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients. A limitation of the current study was that we did not have a follow-up of the fertility status of TC patients. We have demonstrated by use of proteomic analysis that mitochondrial dysfunction is the main cause of infertility in TC patients. Our data suggests that NDUFS1 and CD63 may serve as potential protein biomarkers for mitochondrial dysfunction and sperm maturation in TC patients. Further research on fertility associated proteins CCT3 and SERPINA5 is warranted to establish their utility as clinical biomarkers in these men."

All the participants signed an informed written consent at the time of sperm banking at the Andrology Center, Cleveland Clinic. The cryopreserved semen samples from TC patients before starting cancer therapy were used for proteomic analysis in compliance with the Minimum Information about a Proteomics Experiment (MIAPE) guidelines of the Human Proteome Organization’s Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) for reporting proteomics studies [ 68 ]. Patients also consented to the use of discarded samples in research. The inclusion criteria was the use of cryopreserved samples from all patients before the start of any cancer therapy. This was regardless of the stage or specific disease subtype. Based on the WHO 2010 guidelines, semen samples were divided into normozoospermic (motility > 40%),  n  = 20; and asthenozoospermic (motility < 40%),  n  = 20. We also included a control group ( n  = 20) comprising of normozoospermic infertile men without cancer. These infertile men had not fathered a child in the past 2 years before their enrollment in the study. Female partners of these infertile men were reported to have normal reproductive health following general gynecological evaluation. Semen samples were collected after 2–3 days of sexual abstinence and allowed to liquefy completely for 20–30 min at 37 °C. Semen volume, and sperm motility and concentration were evaluated according to the WHO 2010 guidelines [ 69 ]. Semen samples from TC patients and control group were cryopreserved in TEST-yolk buffer (TYB; Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA, USA) using the slow-freezing protocol [ 70 ]. Cryopreserved samples were thawed at 37 °C for 20 min and centrifuged at 4000×  g  for 10 min to isolate spermatozoa. The sperm pellet was washed four times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA, USA) and centrifuged at 4000×  g  for 10 min at 4 °C. Radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) buffer supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, cOmpleteTM ULTRA Tablets, EDTA-free (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was added to sperm pellet (100 µL RIPA/10 6  sperm) and left overnight at 4 °C for cell lysis. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000×  g  for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube. Protein quantification in the fractions was performed using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pooled samples from 20 normozoospermic men with TC, 11 from asthenozoospermia men with TC and 9 from control group were used for global proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS. The samples in each pool were mixed with SDS Page buffer and separated on a 1D gel and run in triplicates. For the protein digestion step, the bands were cut to minimize excess polyacrylamide, and divided into a number of smaller pieces. The gel pieces were washed with water and dehydrated in acetonitrile. The bands were then reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Subsequently all bands were digested in-gel using trypsin, by adding five μL of 10 ng/μL trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubating overnight at room temperature to achieve complete digestion. The peptides formed were extracted from the polyacrylamide in two aliquots of 30 μL 50% acetonitrile with 5% formic acid. These extracts were combined and evaporated to <10 μL in the Speedvac and then resuspended in 1% acetic acid to make up a final volume of ~30 μL for LC-MS analysis. The LC-MS system was a Finnigan LTQ-Orbitrap Elite hybrid mass spectrometer system. The HPLC was performed using a Dionex 15 cm  ×  75 μm id Acclaim Pepmap C18, 2 μm, 100 Å reversed phase capillary chromatography column as described in our previous publication [ 71 ]. The data was analyzed using all CID spectra collected in the experiment to search the human reference sequence databases ( http://www.hprd.org/ ) with the search program Mascot and Sequest. These search results were then uploaded into the program Scaffold (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA; version 4.0.6.1). The abundance of each protein in the pool was classified as very low, low, medium or high based on the number of spectral counts. The NSAF ratio was calculated to categorize the expression profile of DEPs as under-expressed, overexpressed or unique to one of the groups [ 71 ]. Functional pathway analysis of the DEPs was done using the IPA software (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The IPA program facilitates the evaluation of top canonical pathways, diseases, and bio-functions and upstream regulators related to the DEPs. Comparison analysis was also carried out between the two analyzed datasets (normozoospermic TC vs. control group and asthenozoospermic TC vs. control group) to identify the differences in the canonical pathways regulated by the DEPs. To validate the global proteomic results, sperm proteins related to reproductive function were selected for validation by Western blot (WB). This was performed in a different set of samples from normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients and control group to maintain the biological variability. The criteria for the selection of DEPs for validation by WB included: (1) proteins involved in reproductive system development and function; (2) proteins involved in the top canonical pathways; and (3) proteins with a well-described function in the literature. Four proteins (CCT3; CD63, NDUSF1, and SERPINA5) were selected for validation by WB in individual samples from normozoospermic TC ( n  = 10), asthenozoospermic TC ( n  = 10), and control ( n  = 7) groups. A total of 20 µg of protein per sample was loaded into a 4%–15% SDS–PAGE for 2 h at 90 V. The resolved protein bands were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and for each protein analysis, specific primary antibodies were incubated at 4 °C overnight ( Supplementary Table S2 ). The membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h and finally reacted with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA, USA) for 5 min. Membranes were exposed to Chemi-Doc (ChemiDoc™ MP Imaging System, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) to detect the chemiluminescence signals. All the PVDF membranes used for protein identification were subjected to total protein staining. The membranes were briefly washed twice for 10 min in distilled water and stained with colloidal gold total protein stain (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature by gentle shaking. Stained membranes were washed twice with distilled water for 10 min, and the densitometry image was captured using the colorimetric mode on Chemi-Doc (ChemiDoc™ MP Imaging System, Bio-Rad). Data analysis was performed using MedCalc Statistical Software (version 17.8; MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). After testing for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, the Mann–Whitney test was carried out to compare the semen parameters of the normozoospermic and asthenozoospermia TC patients with that of control group, and a  p  < 0.05 was considered as significant. The same test was used to compare the expression levels of the proteins validated using western blot technique in both the groups."

Stained membranes were washed twice with distilled water for 10 min, and the densitometry image was captured using the colorimetric mode on Chemi-Doc (ChemiDoc™ MP Imaging System, Bio-Rad)."

    "abstract": "Testicular Germ Cell Tumor (GCT) is the most common solid tumor in men between the ages of 20–44. Men diagnosed with GCT have excellent survival rates due to advances in the multimodal treatment paradigm of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. When considering the adequate treatment, several variables should be investigated and known to select the proper procedure. Therefore, when considering Testicular Intra-Epithelial Neoplasia, organ-sparring treatment, such as radiotherapy or organ-sparring surgery should be considered, reaching a cure rate of 98%. However, when the case is of a seminoma or a non-seminoma, orchiectomy is usually the chosen procedure, reaching an oncological cure rate of 80–85%, when there is no metastasis. Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection (RPLND) is generally considered as a treatment option for non-seminomas, when lymph nodes are compromised. There are three different RPLND techniques: open, laparoscopic, and robotic. The open approach is as effective as the other two in its oncological efficiency. Although, when considering both laparoscopic and robotic approach, hospital stays are significantly reduced, better cosmetic results, and less complications when compared to the open approach. Both laparoscopic and robotic approaches require extensive experience and have a steep learning curve, while also providing similar outcome, however, recent studies have been pointing out a slight increase of advantages on the robotic approach. Therefore, further studies are necessary to assert the robotic approach superiority. Also, it is noteworthy that new technologies are on the rise, improving the laparoscopic approach, requiring further studies after their uses are consolidated.",

    "abstract": "The cohort was set up in order to analyze late effects in long-term testicular cancer survivors (TCS) and to contribute to the design of future follow-up programs addressing and potentially preventing late effects. Data for this cross-sectional study were collected between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, among living Danish TCS and 60% agreed to participate in the cohort ( N  = 2,572). Mean time since testicular cancer (TC) diagnosis was 18 years (range 7–33) and mean age of participants was 53 years (range 25–95). Data consist of results of a questionnaire with patient reported outcomes which covers a broad range of items on late-effects. The study also included data obtained through linkages to Danish registries, a biobank, and clinical data from hospital files and pathology reports originating from the Danish Testicular Cancer Database (DaTeCa). The treatment during the observation period has been nearly the same for all stages of TC and is in agreement with today’s standard treatment, this allows for interesting analysis with a wide timespan. We have extensive data on non-responders and are able to validate our study findings. Data from a Danish reference population ( N  = 162,283) allow us to compare our findings with a Danish background population. The cohort can easily be extended to access more outcomes, or include new TCS. A limitation of the present study is the cross-sectional design and despite the large sample size, The Danish Testicular Cancer Late Treatment Effects Cohort (DaTeCa-LATE) lacks statistical power to study very rare late effects. Since it was voluntary to participate in the study we have some selection bias, for instance, we lack responders who were not in a paired relationship, but we would still argue that this cohort of TCSs is representative for TCSs in Denmark.

        "content": "In industrialized countries, testicular cancer (TC) is the most common solid tumor in men between 20 and 40 years of age. In Denmark, the age standardized incidence rate per 100,000 person-years is 9.9 which corresponds to 300 incident cases annually ( 1 ,  2 ). TC is a highly curable tumor with a 5-year survival of 95–98%, which results in an increased population of long-term testicular cancer survivors (TCS). However, treatment is hampered by late effects, including increased risk for secondary cancer ( 3 ,  4 ), metabolic syndrome ( 5 ), cardiovascular disease ( 6 ), neurotoxicity ( 7 ), sexual dysfunction ( 8 ), and psychosocial problems ( 9 ). Nevertheless, our current knowledge of risk factors, the related health problems and the quality of the posttreatment life remains insufficient to fully optimize individual programs designed to address and reduce long-term toxicity and improve quality of life in TC survivors. Historically there have been small variations in standard TC treatment in Denmark, and now it is completely harmonized in national multidisciplinary guidelines for treatment and follow-up carried out at three university hospitals responsible for this patient group. The treatment algorithm is as follows: (a) patients with disease confined to one or both testicles (stage I disease) are treated with orchiectomy followed by surveillance, and approximately 75% of stage I patients are cured by this treatment alone ( 10 ,  11 ); (b) patients with seminoma histology and limited retroperitoneal disease are offered treatment with radiotherapy (RT) or chemotherapy; (c) in the remaining patients with disseminated disease, chemotherapy with three or four courses of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) is the treatment of choice depending on prognostic group; and (d) a minority of patients, approximately 5%, will need more than one line of treatment (MTOL) due to progressive disease or disease relapse. In order to clarify late effects related to treatment, apart from orchiectomy, we have chosen, where appropriate, to use the surveillance group (stage I TC) as a reference group. The Danish Testicular Cancer Late Treatment Effects Cohort (DaTeCa-LATE) consists of a combination of data derived from the clinical database DaTeCa (1984–2007) ( 11 ), national health and sociodemographic registries (1977–2016), a biobank with blood and sputum samples, and an 167-item questionnaire containing patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) obtained in 2014–2016. The cohort design is illustrated in Figure  1 . The Danish Testicular Cancer Late Treatment Effects Cohort (DaTeCa-LATE) cohort design. The cohort was set up in order to analyze treatment-related late effects in TCS and to contribute to the design of future follow-up programs addressing and potentially preventing late effects in long-term TCS. The Danish Testicular Cancer Late Treatment Effects Cohort is a nationwide and population-based cohort and is located at the Department of Oncology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark."

        "content": "In 2014, we accessed the DaTeCa database, which at that time included some 7,500 TC patients. Patients in the database have been identified through the Danish Cancer Register and hospital files. In the present study, we included 5,367 of these patients treated in the period between January 1, 1984, and December 31, 2007, as we aimed for a long observational period facilitating the study of late effects. The mean time since diagnosis is 18 years (range 7–33). Inclusion criteria in the DaTeCa database covers the diagnosis of a germ cell cancer (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, ICD-10: DC 62.1-62.9, DC38.3, and DC48.0, the latter two together with germ cell histology), Danish citizenship, follow-up and medical treatment conducted at an oncology ward in Denmark. The overall coverage in the database is approximately 80% ( 11 ). In the DaTeCa database, we identified a total of 4,271 TCS eligible for participation in DaTeCa-LATE. The main reasons for exclusion of patients ( N  = 1,096) are presented in the flowchart (Figure  2 ). The Danish Testicular Cancer Late Treatment Effects Cohort (DaTeCa-LATE) flowchart. A postal invitation to participate was sent out to all eligible TCS in November 2014. Following written informed consent, patients filled in a questionnaire either in a paper version or electronically. Reminder postal invitations were sent out to non-responders and non-responders were also reached by phone. By December 31, 2016, a total of 2,572 (60%) of questionnaires distributed was filled in and returned, and this number of TCS make up the DaTeCa-LATE study population. Data on TCS non-responders were collected from the DaTeCa database and Danish registries for comparison with responders. As illustrated in Table  1  responders were younger at time of treatment (34 vs. 35 years) and attained age (52 vs. 53 years) than non-responders ( P  < 0.001). Characteristics of responders included in DaTeCa-LATE and non-responders. Age treatment, age attained. and time since diagnosis were compared with independent t-test. Column proportions were compared through chi-squared analysis . a Metachronous and synchronous . b Extragonadal primary ( N  = 123) . BEP, bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin; RT, radiotherapy; MTOL, more than one line of treatment . The response rate was dependent on treatment modality. As such, the response rate was 55% in TCS followed on a surveillance program, 67% in TCS treated with BEP, 58% in TCS treated with RT, and 76% in TCS treated with MTOL. These data suggest that more intensive treatment lead to a higher response rate. Another difference observed, concerns marital status. TCS living in a paired relation had a response rate of 66% compared to men who were single, separated, divorced, or widowed with a response rate of 54% ( P  < 0.001). No difference between responders and non-responders were observed concerning decade of treatment, histology of the tumor, comorbidity at time of filling in the questionnaire and place of living. As a reference population we use data obtained from the Danish National Health Profile survey from 2013 based on five regional stratified random samples and one national random sample. A total of 300 450 individuals, aged 16 or older, were invited to participate with a response rate of 54% (162,283 individuals) ( 12 ). As many of the outcomes in the Danish National Health Profile survey are the same as in DaTeCa-LATE this allows for a straight-forward comparison with the reference population, concerning the following demographic variables and outcomes: alcohol consumption, smoking, education, age, self-rated health, physical activity, perceived stress, physical function, and body mass index. In the present study, continuous variables were compared with independent  t -tests while column proportions were compared with chi-squared analysis. Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The regional ethical committee of the Capital Region of Denmark approved the study (file number, H-2-2012-044). The collection and use of questionnaire data from the reference population were approved by the five regional data protection agencies.

Furthermore, we have found that renal and pulmonary toxicity related to treatment is partly reversible ( 28 ,  29 ). Risk of late relapses is low in surveillance patients, who carries a good prognosis ( 30 ,  31 ). Additionally, we have shown that patients with preexisting Leydig cell dysfunction are at increased risk of testosterone deficiency following treatment ( 32 – 34 ). A new finding from DaTeCa-LATE is that TCS have higher PSS scores than the reference population. This is illustrated in Table  3 , where mean PSS scores were compared between TCS and the reference population with independent  t -test. No cutoff values exist for PSS, but generally a score of 15 or above is considered as a high stress level ( 35 ). In Figure  3 , TCSs PSS score was categorized in age groups and allocated into quartiles according to reference group quartile PSS scores. Confined to TCS < 65 years of age we found a higher level of perceived stress compared to the reference population. In total, 16–19% of TCS < 65 years of age had PSS scores in the lowest quartile, while 53–64% had PSS scores in the two highest quartiles. Perceived stress scale (PSS), total scores. PSS mean total score compared with independent t-test . Testicular cancer survivors perceived stress scale (PSS) scores categorized in age groups and allocated into quartiles according to reference group quartile PSS scores. To further elaborate on this primary analysis of PSS, we plan comparison of TCS level of perceived stress and lifestyle factors (physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption) with the reference population. In addition we will compare PSS scores of TCS with survivors of other cancer types. Planned studies from DaTeCa-LATE include evaluation of quality of life and sexual function in bilateral TC as well as analysis of quality of life, education, psychiatric diseases and drug abuse, fatigue, sexual function, and paternity rate stratified on treatment modality and compared with a non-cancerous reference population when applicable. In addition, genetic differences related to toxicity and more rarely explored late-effects will be investigated. Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and R software (R Core Development Team, Vienna, Austria). We plan an additional follow-up survey of the cohort after 5–10 years as well as an extension adding more recently diagnosed cases of TC."

        "section_name": "What are the Main Strengths and Weaknesses?",
        "content": "The Danish Testicular Cancer Late Treatment Effects Cohort is the largest cohort of TCS with a long observation period since diagnosis and treatment. The study is nationwide and population based which together with the long time since diagnosis leads to a high degree of reliability of the results obtained in various studies. The study includes a combination of an excessive number of clinical data, comprehensive PROM data, and access to various administrative register data established independently of the hypothesis under study. This type of data almost completely avoid the possibility that selection, information as well as recall bias influence the results, securing a high validity of the observations. The treatment during the observation period has been nearly the same for all stages of TC and is in agreement with today’s standard treatment. Patients responding to the questionnaire can be compared with non-responders and a reference population. The cohort can easily be extended to assess additional outcomes, or include new TC patients. A possible limitation is the differences observed in age, marital status and treatment modality between responders and non-responders of the questionnaire. However, the absolute difference in age is negligible and the proportion of patients treated with surveillance, BEP and RT is representative of today’s TC treatment pattern. Thus, we do not expect that these differences will influence the interpretation of PROM data. The difference in marital status with more responders than non-responders living in a paired relation is in accordance with the findings of other similar studies ( 36 ), and the finding can be problematic in special cases, but overall we find that this cohort of TCSs is representative for TCSs in Denmark. As >95% of TC patients become long-term survivors, survivor bias is generally not a limitation. However, as the mortality is high in the MTOL group, interpretation of especially PROM data among these patients should be done with caution, as they might represent a highly selected group of TC who have survived several lines of TC treatment. Despite the fact that TC is a rare tumor implying that some rare outcomes would be difficult to investigate, the advantages of the information in this large cohort of TC provide a data set that is highly interesting for future studies."

    "title": "Cisplatin treatment of testicular cancer patients introduces long-term changes in the epigenome",
    "abstract": "Background Cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CBCT) is part of standard treatment of several cancers. In testicular cancer (TC) survivors, an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS) is observed. In this epigenome-wide association study, we investigated if CBCT relates to epigenetic changes (DNA methylation) and if epigenetic changes render individuals susceptible for developing MetS later in life. We analyzed methylation profiles, using the MethylationEPIC BeadChip, in samples collected ~ 16 years after treatment from 279 Norwegian TC survivors with known MetS status. Among the CBCT treated ( n  = 176) and non-treated ( n  = 103), 61 and 34 developed MetS, respectively. We used two linear regression models to identify if (i) CBCT results in epigenetic changes and (ii) epigenetic changes play a role in development of MetS. Then we investigated if these changes in (i) and (ii) links to genes, functional networks, and pathways related to MetS symptoms. Results We identified 35 sites that were differentially methylated when comparing CBCT treated and untreated TC survivors. The PTK6–RAS–MAPk pathway was significantly enriched with these sites and infers a gene network of 13 genes with  CACNA1D  (involved in insulin release) as a network hub .  We found nominal MetS-associations and a functional gene network with  ABCG1  and  NCF2  as network hubs. Conclusion Our results suggest that CBCT has long-term effects on the epigenome. We could not directly link the CBCT effects to the risk of developing MetS. Nevertheless, since we identified differential methylation occurring in genes associated with conditions pertaining to MetS, we hypothesize that epigenomic changes may also play a role in the development of MetS in TC survivors. Further studies are needed to validate this hypothesis.",

        "content": "After the introduction of cisplatin in the treatment of testicular cancer (TC) in the late 1970s [ 1 ], this malignancy has become a model for curative treatment even in case of metastatic disease. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CBCT) has been integrated into standard treatment of several cancers in addition to TC, including gynecological, lung, bladder, and head and neck cancer [ 2 ]. For men with metastatic TC, three to four cycles of cisplatin in combination with etoposide and bleomycin (BEP) comprise the cornerstone in the treatment of metastatic disease [ 3 ], yielding 5-year disease-specific survival rates > 90% [ 4 ]. Due to the excellent prognosis and young age at diagnosis, TC survivors can expect to live for 30–50 years after successful treatment [ 5 ]. However, the very long-term relative survival among TC survivors is lower than among the age-matched population [ 6 ], primarily related to increased risks of second cancers and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [ 5 ]. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a well described late effect after TC treatment and is a possible mediator of both the increased risk of second cancers as well as CVD [ 7 – 9 ]. The prevalence of MetS in the general population differs according to MetS definition and increases by age, affecting about 20–25% of most Western populations [ 10 ,  11 ]. MetS including hypertension, increased body mass index (BMI), pre-diabetic biochemical serum changes, and/or hyperlipidemia is a constellation of risk factors for CVD [ 12 ]. An increased age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for developing MetS after CBCT has been found when compared with patients treated with only surgery [ 9 ,  13 ,  14 ], although these results are not quite consistent [ 15 ]. Cisplatin exposure has been shown to result in drug-induced DNA hypermethylation both in vitro and in vivo [ 16 – 19 ]. In recent years, evidence for epigenetic changes predisposing to MetS has also been documented [ 20 – 22 ]; it is therefore plausible that these changes caused by CBCT could be involved in the development of MetS. Identification of differential DNA methylation (DNAm) in TC survivors that develop MetS compared to those who do not could provide a better understanding for the underlying mechanisms behind this serious late effect. We hypothesize that epigenetic changes caused by CBCT render TC survivors susceptible for developing MetS later in life. The aim of this study was to (i) evaluate the potential long-term effect of CBCT on the epigenome in a cohort of Norwegian TC survivors, and (ii) identify possible associations between epigenetic changes and development of MetS. We also investigated if these changes in (i) and (ii) links to genes, functional networks, and pathways related to MetS symptoms."

We checked if genomic coordinates of the CpGs of interest were present as SNPs in GWAS Central database. We did not find any of the CBCT, MetS, and overlapping CpG sites from Tables  2 ,  3 , and  4 , respectively. In the EWAS Atlas database, we found one association with post-obese (cg07677157), and one association with high-saturated fatty acids diet (cg07677157) for CBCT-associated CpGs.

        "section_name": "Discussion",
        "content": "In this EWAS, we identified lasting CBCT-related effects in 35 differentially methylated CpG sites across the genome, on average 16 years after treatment. These effects may be attributed to the initial CBCT, and/or to the small amount of platinum persistent in serum post-treatment [ 5 ]. We found insulin- and body mass-related genes in proximity to the CBCT-associated hits, supporting our hypothesis that the CBCT-MetS relationship is linked to epigenetics. Interestingly, we found CpG sites in proximity to the gene  ABCG1 , which has been associated to body mass, triglycerides, HDL-C, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes in EWAS [ 23 – 25 ], among our nominally significant MetS CpGs. The gene closest to the CBCT− top hit, cg07677157, is  RPSAP52 , a gene linked to type 2 diabetes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [ 26 ]. The top annotated CBCT gene,  CACNA1D , encodes voltage-dependent calcium channels, which regulate insulin release. Polymorphisms in  CACNA1D  are also associated with type 2 diabetes [ 27 ], linked to diastolic and systolic blood pressure [ 28 ], and ototoxicity [ 29 ]. Other CBCT-associated genes were  ACOT7 , implicated in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes [ 30 ] and atherosclerosis [ 31 ];  GRHL1 , encoding a transcription factor involved in epithelial development and linked to several types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and type 1 diabetes; and  TOM1L2 , linked to body mass and type 2 diabetes in GWAS [ 32 ] (Table  2 ). We found “PTK6 Regulates RHO GTPases, RAS GTPase, and MAP kinases” which is part of the RAS signal transduction pathway enriched with CBCT-associated methylation. The pathway regulates cell differentiation and plays a role in cell proliferation [ 33 – 35 ], which might be a relevant mechanism in relation to the increased risk of second cancer after CBCT in TC survivors [ 36 ]. The pathway “cellular response to growth hormone stimulus” is also enriched for CpGs associated to CBCT. The involvement of these oncogenic pathways is consistent with the cytotoxicity of CBCT, which is interesting considering the rather long time window between treatment and DNAm measurements. Examples of MetS-associated genes include  COLEC12 , encoding a scavenger receptor involved in several functions associated with host defense;  NCF2 , for which increased expression has been observed in patients with insulin resistance [ 37 ]; and  SMG7 , playing a role in p53 function in response to DNA damage [ 38 ]. The possible relationship between CBCT-induced DNAm and susceptibility for developing MetS was analyzed by exploring the sequence of events separately, as there are no well-established tools for doing high-dimension mediation analysis that fit with our design. The overlap between the two models, including the top 2000 hits, was ten sites (Table  4 ). These might be spurious findings since associations were nominal. The small overlap might suggest two unrelated mechanisms leading to MetS which was supported by publicly available distinct EWAS (EWAS Atlas). Nonetheless, for both models, the majority of top CpGs was linked to factors pertaining to MetS. Additionally, among the genes that clustered in the network analysis, those with the highest network degree ( CACNA1D ,  DIP2C , and  GRHL1  for CBCT, and  ABCG1  and  NCF2  for MetS) were all associated with MetS. The network analyses suggest that CBCT and MetS-related effects may be mediated synergistically. We speculate that changes in methylation in these clustered genes might affect gene expression, thus increasing the likelihood of developing MetS. These findings support the notion that DNAm may mediate the effect of CBCT on MetS risk later in life. Validation and replication of the top results are needed in an independent cohort. Inclusion of a non-oncological control group, with and without MetS, will further elucidate if the findings are independent of tumor intrinsic factors, and if the MetS hits are related to CBCT. The survivors in our study who developed MetS have somewhat lower testosterone levels than those without MetS, regardless of CBCT, thus low testosterone may have confounded the results. Previous studies have shown that lower total testosterone level is associated with higher risk of developing MetS [ 39 ]. Independently of the model used, testosterone did not markedly alter the significant associations. This indicates that the MetS DNAm association is not attributable to low testosterone levels. Strengths of the study include a reliable and broadly characterized study population which has been followed for many years. In addition, we have considered the most important confounding factors by matching the groups. Furthermore, the epigenetic analyses have been performed on EPIC BeadChip arrays, which provides state-of-the art tool for epigenome-wide association analyses, covering over 850,000 CpG sites. The EPIC array represents a significant improvement compared to its predecessor, the HM450 array, with increased genome coverage of regulatory regions [ 40 ]. Finally, we used curated annotation resources and updated GRCh38/hg38 genome [ 41 ]. Some limitations of the present study should also be considered. Even though the total number of TC survivors was large, the sample size of those treated with surgery only and developed MetS was 34. Due to the limited sample size, we chose the minimally adjusted model for MetS. A power issue may thus contribute as to why there were no differentially DNA methylated CpG sites associated with MetS after adjusting for multiple testing. We were not able to distinguish between the effect of the initial CBCT and the effect of platinum residuals [ 5 ] as this would have needed a time-series analysis. It is not possible to rule out that some of the differential DNA methylation associated to CBCT could be related to tumor-specific intrinsic factors. However, TC stage markers of DNA methylation including HOXA9, RASSF1A, and SCGB3A1 [ 42 ] were not observed, indicating that potential confounding by such factors was unlikely. The possible impact of second primary cancer is negligible due to long time span between sampling and diagnosis."

        "content": "Our results suggest that CBCT has long-term effects on the epigenome. Although we could not directly link the CBCT effects to the risk of developing MetS, it may still play a role in the development of MetS in TC survivors. This is supported by the observation that the differential DNAm occurs in genes related to MetS. Furthermore, our results contribute to a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms behind the development of MetS in TC survivors treated with CBCT. Although the influence of CBCT on the epigenome is plausible, validation of the observed differential methylation of specific CpGs is necessary. Our findings also indicate that other adverse effects of CBCT, such as ototoxicity, may be mediated by epigenetic changes. These topics could be subject to future studies, also encompassing other cancer forms using CBCT, and risk of second cancer. In terms of clinical perspective, our results may provide early identification of individuals with increased risk for development of MetS."

        "content": "Participants were long-term survivors of unilateral TC diagnosed from 18 to 75 years of age, treated between 1980 and 1994. The original national cohort consisted of 1463 men (Caucasians) who participated in follow-up survey I (SI) at five Norwegian university hospitals during the period 1998–2002. In total, 990 males, younger than 60 years old at SI, were subsequently evaluated with regard to CVD and MetS in a second survey (SII) performed 2007–2008 [ 15 ]. A third survey (SIII) was performed in 2015–2016. Overall, 279 participants with MetS data obtained in SII, and frozen whole blood samples from either SI ( n  = 137), SII ( n  = 132), or SIII ( n  = 8) available for DNA analyses, were included in the present study. We included the samples that best fitted the matching criteria (see below). For those who had samples from more than one survey, we chose the DNA obtained at the earliest time point after diagnosis to capture as much of the CBCT related effects as possible. Data from questionnaires, clinical examinations (including blood pressure and waist circumference measurements), and laboratory tests (including fasting blood glucose and blood lipid measurements) were retrieved from SII. Smoking status was classified from questionnaire data into three groups: never, former, and current smoker. Age was used as a continuous variable in all statistical analyses. All routine blood samples were analyzed at the Oslo University Hospital. Plasma levels of lipids and glucose were measured enzymatically. Serum levels of testosterone were determined using immunoassays. MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program expert panel, as the presence of minimum three of the following five criteria: blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg, HDL-cholesterol < 1.0 mmol/L, triglycerides ≥ 1.7 mmol/L, waist circumference > 102 cm, and fasting glucose ≥ 6.5 mmol/L [ 43 ,  44 ]. Epigenomic changes related to MetS were assumed to be present at the sampling time point. Data regarding initial tumor stage, histology, and treatment details were retrieved from medical records. Treatment details according to stage and histology [ 45 ], CVD risk, and morbidity data from SI and SII have been published previously [ 9 ,  15 ,  46 ,  47 ]. Cancer Registry follow-up showed that 51 survivors acquired a second primary cancer within the cohort follow-up time (SIII). These cancers were diagnosed on average 6 (SD = 3) years after sample donation. From the 279 TC survivors included, 103 had surgery only (orchiectomy with or without retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for selected cases) due to stage I disease, whereas 176 had undergone both surgery and CBCT (all with metastatic disease) (Fig.  1 ). From the surgery only (CBCT−) and the treatment (CBCT+) groups, we selected similar fractions of patients with MetS. These four groups were frequency-matched on smoking habits and age at blood sampling, allowing no more than two years difference in mean age. However, complete matching was not possible due to limited number of patients categorized as CBCT+ and MetS−. From this 2 × 2 design, we analyzed the data using a CBCT model and a MetS model, where all cases were included in both models (Fig.  1 ). Comparing the top hits from the two models enables the identification of CpG sites associated with both CBCT and MetS. This study was approved by Regional Ethical Committee (REC) south east D, reference 2015/1332. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using standard chloroform–phenol extraction method. DNA concentration and purity of the DNA samples were analyzed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA from ten samples was isolated using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) and the Qiacube (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Of the 279 samples, four samples had only 300 ng (500 ng recommended); however, they showed good array quality in all control steps. Bisulfite conversion of the genomic DNA was done using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo) and whole-genome DNAm were analyzed with the Infinium MethylationEPIC Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. This array covers 850,000 individual CpGs at CpG islands, RefSeq genes, ENCODE open chromatin, ENCODE transcription factor binding sites, and FANTOM5 enhancers sites. The 279 samples were randomized on three 96-well plates according to the four groups described. The resulting raw data were analyzed using minfi v.1.20.2 in the R statistical environment v3.3.3 [ 48 ]. For details, see Supplementary method information. Two samples were excluded, one due to missing smoking information, and one being an outlier in the principal component analyses (Additional file  1 : Figure S1). This resulted in a quality-controlled dataset of 277 samples and 862,400 CpG sites. CpG sites were mapped to the human genome (GRCh37/hg19) using the annotation file provided by the manufacturer (Illumina) [ 49 ] and further curated and translated to GRCh38/hg38 [ 41 ]. Additional information were retrieved from the UCSC genome browser [ 50 ,  51 ] and GeneCards ( www.genecards.org ) [ 52 ] and Gene2Function ( http://www.gene2function.org ) [ 53 ]. Relative proportion of cell types (B cells, CD4 +  T cells, CD8 +  T cells, natural killer cells, granulocytes, and monocytes) from the methylation profiles were estimated using the reference-based Houseman method [ 54 ,  55 ]. We deployed GENIUS (GEne Networks Inference Using Signatures) tool to predict local gene networks and key genes for biological functions [ 56 ]. The network was constructed using supervised machine learning method to find expression signatures. Input for the gene network was the FDR significant genes from the CBCT and MetS model. The network was visualized with Cytoscope 3.7.1 according to the nodes connectivity and degree [ 57 ]. The methylation values were transformed to β values (between 0 and 1), representing the intensity of methylation [ 58 ]. We used a linear regression model to investigate if cell type composition was associated with CBCT, adjusting for age at blood sampling and smoking habits. We also tested if MetS was associated with testosterone levels, adjusting for age. The results indicated that testosterone and cell type (five out of six cell types, B cells was dropped) composition might be confounders. The robust linear CBCT model with DNA methylation status as the dependent variable was therefore adjusted for age, smoking, cell type, and testosterone. To investigate the associations between DNAm and MetS with the latter as the dependent variable, we used a generalized logistic regression model. The MetS model was adjusted for age, smoking, and CBCT. Models with the best fit were included, and additional regression models tested are available in the Supplementary information (Additional file  1 : Figure S4 and Figure S5). Additionally, separate generalized logistic regression models with the five variables underlying the MetS diagnosis (hypertension, cholesterol, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and triglycerides) as dependent variable and with the same covariates were tested. To adjust for multiple testing, Benjamini and Hochberg’s FDR [ 59 ] and Bonferroni correction [ 60 ] were applied to all models. Differentially methylated CpG sites, identified in the CBCT model and the MetS model, were defined as the intersection of the top 2000 hits with the lowest unadjusted  p  values. In order to identify differentially methylated regions (DMR), we used two approaches, bumphunter [ 61 ] and dmrcate [ 62 – 64 ]. Bumphunter (v.1.20.0) was run with 1000 permutations and the cutoff was set to 0.05, corresponding to 5% difference on the β values on the CBCT model. We ran the DMRcate function (v.1.14.0) with default settings (max gap 1000 nucleotides between two significant probes and DNAm as outcome) on the CBCT model and by flipping the function around with the dichotomous variable as outcome on the CBCT and MetS models. CpG sites passing an FDR adjustment ( p  value < 0.1) were used to assess pathways enriched for differential DNAm. We employed Enrichr ( http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr ) [ 65 ,  66 ] a platform for KEGG [ 67 ], Reactome 2016 (v.62), and Gene Ontology (GO) 2018 (biological process, molecular function, and cellular component) pathways analysis [ 68 ,  69 ]. We performed an unweighted analysis, and reported  p  values are based on Fisher’s exact test. We employed GWAS Central database ( www.gwascentral.org ) to evaluate if any of CpG sites of interest were previously reported as known SNPs [ 70 ]. We further scanned for associations between CpG sites of interest and known epigenome-wide associations from literature studies. We used the EWAS Atlas resource ( https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ewas/index ) [ 71 ]. This database features a large number of high-quality, manually curated, EWAS associations."

Epigenomic changes related to MetS were assumed to be present at the sampling time point. Data regarding initial tumor stage, histology, and treatment details were retrieved from medical records. Treatment details according to stage and histology [ 45 ], CVD risk, and morbidity data from SI and SII have been published previously [ 9 ,  15 ,  46 ,  47 ]. Cancer Registry follow-up showed that 51 survivors acquired a second primary cancer within the cohort follow-up time (SIII). These cancers were diagnosed on average 6 (SD = 3) years after sample donation. From the 279 TC survivors included, 103 had surgery only (orchiectomy with or without retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for selected cases) due to stage I disease, whereas 176 had undergone both surgery and CBCT (all with metastatic disease) (Fig.  1 ). From the surgery only (CBCT−) and the treatment (CBCT+) groups, we selected similar fractions of patients with MetS. These four groups were frequency-matched on smoking habits and age at blood sampling, allowing no more than two years difference in mean age. However, complete matching was not possible due to limited number of patients categorized as CBCT+ and MetS−. From this 2 × 2 design, we analyzed the data using a CBCT model and a MetS model, where all cases were included in both models (Fig.  1 ). Comparing the top hits from the two models enables the identification of CpG sites associated with both CBCT and MetS. This study was approved by Regional Ethical Committee (REC) south east D, reference 2015/1332."

DNA concentration and purity of the DNA samples were analyzed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA from ten samples was isolated using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) and the Qiacube (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Of the 279 samples, four samples had only 300 ng (500 ng recommended); however, they showed good array quality in all control steps. Bisulfite conversion of the genomic DNA was done using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo) and whole-genome DNAm were analyzed with the Infinium MethylationEPIC Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. This array covers 850,000 individual CpGs at CpG islands, RefSeq genes, ENCODE open chromatin, ENCODE transcription factor binding sites, and FANTOM5 enhancers sites. The 279 samples were randomized on three 96-well plates according to the four groups described. The resulting raw data were analyzed using minfi v.1.20.2 in the R statistical environment v3.3.3 [ 48 ]. For details, see Supplementary method information. Two samples were excluded, one due to missing smoking information, and one being an outlier in the principal component analyses (Additional file  1 : Figure S1). This resulted in a quality-controlled dataset of 277 samples and 862,400 CpG sites. CpG sites were mapped to the human genome (GRCh37/hg19) using the annotation file provided by the manufacturer (Illumina) [ 49 ] and further curated and translated to GRCh38/hg38 [ 41 ]. Additional information were retrieved from the UCSC genome browser [ 50 ,  51 ] and GeneCards ( www.genecards.org ) [ 52 ] and Gene2Function ( http://www.gene2function.org ) [ 53 ]. Relative proportion of cell types (B cells, CD4 +  T cells, CD8 +  T cells, natural killer cells, granulocytes, and monocytes) from the methylation profiles were estimated using the reference-based Houseman method [ 54 ,  55 ]. We deployed GENIUS (GEne Networks Inference Using Signatures) tool to predict local gene networks and key genes for biological functions [ 56 ]. The network was constructed using supervised machine learning method to find expression signatures. Input for the gene network was the FDR significant genes from the CBCT and MetS model. The network was visualized with Cytoscope 3.7.1 according to the nodes connectivity and degree [ 57 ]."

        "content": "The methylation values were transformed to β values (between 0 and 1), representing the intensity of methylation [ 58 ]. We used a linear regression model to investigate if cell type composition was associated with CBCT, adjusting for age at blood sampling and smoking habits. We also tested if MetS was associated with testosterone levels, adjusting for age. The results indicated that testosterone and cell type (five out of six cell types, B cells was dropped) composition might be confounders. The robust linear CBCT model with DNA methylation status as the dependent variable was therefore adjusted for age, smoking, cell type, and testosterone. To investigate the associations between DNAm and MetS with the latter as the dependent variable, we used a generalized logistic regression model. The MetS model was adjusted for age, smoking, and CBCT. Models with the best fit were included, and additional regression models tested are available in the Supplementary information (Additional file  1 : Figure S4 and Figure S5). Additionally, separate generalized logistic regression models with the five variables underlying the MetS diagnosis (hypertension, cholesterol, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and triglycerides) as dependent variable and with the same covariates were tested. To adjust for multiple testing, Benjamini and Hochberg’s FDR [ 59 ] and Bonferroni correction [ 60 ] were applied to all models. Differentially methylated CpG sites, identified in the CBCT model and the MetS model, were defined as the intersection of the top 2000 hits with the lowest unadjusted  p  values. In order to identify differentially methylated regions (DMR), we used two approaches, bumphunter [ 61 ] and dmrcate [ 62 – 64 ]. Bumphunter (v.1.20.0) was run with 1000 permutations and the cutoff was set to 0.05, corresponding to 5% difference on the β values on the CBCT model. We ran the DMRcate function (v.1.14.0) with default settings (max gap 1000 nucleotides between two significant probes and DNAm as outcome) on the CBCT model and by flipping the function around with the dichotomous variable as outcome on the CBCT and MetS models."

    "title": "Radiological Assessment of Different Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Measurements in Stage 1 Testicular Cancer Patients: Impact on Clinical Stage and Treatment",
    "abstract": "Background:  In staging for testicular germ cell tumor (GCT), current guidelines lack consensus regarding the measurement of retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis, concerning the recommended plane and dimension. This exploratory study aimed to assess its impact on clinical stage (cS) and therapy.  Methods:  We retrospectively examined 154 cSI (retroperitoneal lymph nodes < 10 mm in axial short-axis diameter (SAD)) GCT patients, without adjuvant therapy and a follow-up ≥ 24 months. Retroperitoneal lymph nodes were measured in staging images in different dimensions (SAD and long-axis diameter (LAD)) and planes (axial, sagittal and coronal).  Results:  Overall survival was 100%, with 82% free of recurrence after a median follow-up of 83 months. All patients were classified as cSI, based on axial SAD (RECIST 1.1). However, significantly more patients would have been classified as cSIIA (0% vs. 38% vs. 52%) or even cSIIB (0% vs. 1% vs. 25%) according to axial LAD (SWENOTECA, German S3 guideline) or maximum LAD in any plane (EAU, ESMO, AJCC and onkopedia) ( p <  0.001). Overtreatment was predicted in 0%, 31% and 61% of patients based on axial SAD, axial LAD and maximum LAD, while undertreatment was estimated at 18%, 10% and 2%, respectively, ( p  < 0.001).  Conclusions:  These findings indicate considerable variability in cS based on current lymph node staging recommendations, suggesting that axial SAD (RECIST 1.1) could be the most appropriate parameter for standardized guideline recommendations.",

        "content": "Testicular germ cell tumors (GCT) are the most common malignancy among young men between the ages of 20 and 40 years [ 1 ]. Although it is a very aggressive tumor entity, cure rates and overall survival of the mostly young patients have steadily improved for years due to advancements in treatment. However, long-term relative survival rate gradually decreases, even after 30 years of follow-up, likely due to the adverse effects of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy [ 2 ]. Staging in GCT patients to identify metastasis relies on cross-sectional imaging, which determines the clinical stage (cS) as follows: cSI indicates a non-metastasized tumor, cSII refers to retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis (IIA: ≥10–20 mm, IIB: >20–50 mm, IIC: >50 mm), and cSIII represents distant lymph node and organ metastasis [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. The size of lymph nodes is consistently defined in current guidelines, but the specific dimensions—short-axis diameter (SAD) and long-axis diameter (LAD)—and planes (axial, sagittal or coronal), recommended for cross-sectional imaging, vary between sources [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]. The Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), the radiological standard for monitoring treatment response in solid tumors, recommends using the maximum axial SAD [ 9 ]. In comparison, the maximum LAD in the axial plane is proposed by the S3-guideline of the German Society of Urology (DGU) [ 4 ]. Similarly, the Swedish and Norwegian Testicular Cancer Group (SWENOTECA) follows a “modified Royal Marsden Hospital staging system”, also based on axial LAD [ 8 ]. Most other guidelines, including those from the European Association of Urology (EAU) [ 3 ], the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [ 5 ], the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) [ 7 ] and onkopedia (Guidelines of the Medical Societies in Hematology and Medical Oncology of German speaking countries) [ 6 ], rely on the maximum LAD in any plane following the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) classification [ 10 ]. A recent survey of German urologists and genitourinary oncologists, specializing in the treatment of GCT patients, highlighted the clinical impact of these inconsistencies. Of the urologists surveyed, 55% used SAD in axial or any dimension, while 45% employed LAD, mostly in the axial dimension [ 11 ]. This variance could lead to discrepancies in staging (cS), which in turn affects treatment decisions, potentially leading to over- or undertreatment. Overtreatment could expose patients to unnecessary acute and long-term toxicities, while undertreatment may increase relapse risk. This is a very important issue, as most GCT patients are young with a long life expectancy. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the different lymph node measurement approaches at initial staging with consecutive cS and therapy, aiming to identify an optimal, standardized measurement parameter that balances the risks of over- and undertreatment while mitigating relapse risk."

In our study, cSI was defined as retroperitoneal lymph nodes < 10 mm in axial SAD on computed tomography. Staging was performed at orchiectomy. Patients with suspiciously shaped lymph nodes, measuring <10 mm in axial SAD in the primary landing zone, or those with questionable cSIIA (in axial SAD), were re-staged after six weeks. They were only further examined, if marker-negative cSI was confirmed. This exploratory study includes a total of 154 patients after orchiectomy without any adjuvant therapy, with normalized postoperative serum tumor markers, and a follow-up period ≥ 24 months. The entire patient inclusion/exclusion flowchart is depicted in  Figure S1 . We adhered to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) recommendations [ 12 ]. Clinical data and pathological characteristics were assessed. The follow-up was conducted according to the recommendations of the German Testicular Cancer Study Group [ 4 ]. We defined relapse as enlargement of retroperitoneal lymph nodes ≥ 10 mm in axial SAD, elevation of tumor markers or distant metastasis during follow-up. We obtained ethical approval from the local ethics committee (2021-15756-retrospektiv). Two experienced uro-radiologists (KN, LK) independently measured retroperitoneal lymph nodes using the software Siemens Healthineers syngo.via VB60A. In case of inconsistent measurements concerning the largest lymph node in axial SAD, a consensus reading followed. The largest lymph node in axial SAD was subsequently measured across various dimensions (SAD and LAD) in the three different radiological planes: axial, sagittal and coronal. We did not define a lower threshold value. If lymph nodes were too small to be precisely measured on 5-mm CT slices, a default value of 2.5 mm was applied for further statistical analysis of these lymph nodes. We also examined the differences in treatment resulting from the different lymph node measurement recommendations regarding relapse occurrence. Consequently, we concentrated on the threshold value for a pathological lymph node, defined as ≥10 mm according to current guidelines. Groups were defined as follows:  (1) correct staging/treatment  (a) lymph node < 10 mm (≙cSI) and no relapse, (b) lymph node ≥ 10 mm (≙cS ≥ IIA) and relapse, (2) overstaging/overtreatment = lymph node ≥ 10 mm (≙cS ≥ IIA) and no relapse, (3) understaging/undertreatment = lymph node < 10 mm (≙cSI) and relapse. correct staging/treatment  (a) lymph node < 10 mm (≙cSI) and no relapse, (b) lymph node ≥ 10 mm (≙cS ≥ IIA) and relapse, lymph node < 10 mm (≙cSI) and no relapse, lymph node ≥ 10 mm (≙cS ≥ IIA) and relapse, overstaging/overtreatment = lymph node ≥ 10 mm (≙cS ≥ IIA) and no relapse, understaging/undertreatment = lymph node < 10 mm (≙cSI) and relapse. In our study cohort, all patients were classified as cSI based on axial SAD and did not receive any adjuvant therapy. Thus, overstaging or overtreatment in axial SAD was absent. In comparison, according to the other lymph node measurements, which also included patients classified as cSI, we further analyzed the patients classified as hypothetical cS ≥ IIA, considering the need for the hypothetical adjuvant therapy they might have received. Patients classified as “overtreated” would have undergone unnecessary radiotherapy or chemotherapy (30/36 Gy  or 3× BEP). “Undertreatment” would have led to delayed relapse diagnosis, potentially increasing cS and the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) risk group [ 13 ], thus necessitating more intense treatment—such as 36 Gy  instead of 30 Gy  for seminoma (if cSIIB instead of cSIIA) or 4× BEP instead of 3× BEP (if IGCCCG risk group would have been intermediate or poor). For statistical analysis, we used IBM  SPSS Statistics System  for Windows, v29.0 (Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were presented as n (%), while continuous variables were reported as the median with 1st and 3rd quartiles. Group comparisons for continuous variables were performed using t-test, while categorial variables were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test, Mann–Whitney test and Pearson‘s Chi-square test. A  p  value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant and a 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied. Effect sizes for mean differences between the different guideline recommendations on cS and therapy were calculated according to Cohen (1988) [ 14 ]. The classification was as follows: a small effect from r = 0.1, a medium effect from r = 0.3, and a large effect from r = 0.5. In addition to the overall cohort analysis, we categorized patients into recurrence-free and those with recurrence during follow-up (≥24 months) after orchiectomy, to classify into hypothetical over- and undertreatment. Group comparisons were conducted using the aforementioned statistical tests. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to determine associations between recurrence risk and histological risk factors. The corresponding effect sizes were reported using Cohen’s f 2  (1988) [ 14 ], with a small effect from f 2  = 0.02, a medium effect from f 2  = 0.15, and a large effect from f 2  = 0.35."

In addition to the overall cohort analysis, we categorized patients into recurrence-free and those with recurrence during follow-up (≥24 months) after orchiectomy, to classify into hypothetical over- and undertreatment. Group comparisons were conducted using the aforementioned statistical tests. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to determine associations between recurrence risk and histological risk factors. The corresponding effect sizes were reported using Cohen’s f 2  (1988) [ 14 ], with a small effect from f 2  = 0.02, a medium effect from f 2  = 0.15, and a large effect from f 2  = 0.35."

        "content": "This study included a total of 154 cSI GCT patients. Seminoma and NSGCT (non-seminomatous germ cell tumor) were present in 106 (69%) and 48 (31%) patients, respectively. The majority had a low pT stage, with pT1 in 112 (73%) patients. Further patient characteristics are detailed in  Table S1 . Overall survival (OS) was 100% with a median follow-up of 83 (Q1 = 59; Q3 = 120) months. Relapse occurred in 27 (18%) patients, with a median relapse time of 14 (Q1 = 9; Q3 = 29) months, which is shown in the Kaplan–Meier curve in  Figure S2 . The relapse rates did not differ significantly between seminoma and NSGCT patients ( p  = 0.255;  Figure S3 ). Most relapses were located in retroperitoneal lymph nodes ( n  = 25; 93%), while an exclusively mediastinal and inguinal lymph node relapse occurred in one patient (4%), respectively. Based on patients’ data, only initial pT stage was substantially higher in relapsed patients ( p  = 0.043;  Table 1 ). At relapse, most patients ( n  = 19; 70%) presented with low-volume disease (cSIIA/B), and 26 (96%) patients were categorized as having a good prognosis according to the IGCCCG classification, with one patient (4%) classified as intermediate prognosis due to elevated serum tumor markers. No relapse occurred with isolated elevation of tumor markers. The most common treatment at relapse was 3–4× BEP (Bleomycin/Etoposide/Cisplatin) chemotherapy in 25 (93%) patients, while two (7%) patients received radiotherapy. cS differed significantly depending on the radiological retroperitoneal lymph node measurement recommended by different guidelines ( p  < 0.001;  Figure 1 ). According to axial SAD measurement (RECIST 1.1), all patients were classified as cSI. In contrast, according to SWENOTECA and DGU, which recommend the axial LAD, only 94 (61%, CI [53.9, 68.2]) patients would be classified as cSI. Other guidelines, using the maximum LAD, would result in just 36 (23%, CI [17.5, 29.9]) patients being classified as cSI, with 80 (52%, CI [44.7, 59.1]) patients classified as cSIIA and even 38 (25%, CI [18.8, 30.7]) patients as cSIIB. The discrepancy between RECIST 1.1 and SWENOTECA or DGU indicated a medium effect size based on Cohen’s criteria ( p  < 0.001, r = 0.49). A medium effect size was also shown for the comparison between SWENOTECA or DGU and the other guidelines (such as EAU, ESMO, onkopedia, AJCC) ( p  < 0.001, r = 0.44). However, the difference between RECIST 1.1 and the other guidelines demonstrated a large effect size according to Cohen ( p  < 0.001, r = 0.77). The differing lymph node measurement methods recommended by current guidelines would also result in significantly different therapeutic recommendations ( p  < 0.001;  Table S2 ). Using axial SAD (RECIST 1.1), 120 (78%, CI [72.1, 83.8]) patients were classified as cSI without risk factors, which led to a surveillance-based treatment. The remaining 34 (22%, CI [16.2, 27.9]) patients were classified as cSI with risk factors. They had the choice between surveillance and adjuvant therapy (1× BEP or 1× Carboplatin AUC 7), with all choosing surveillance. However, based on axial LAD (SWENOTECA, DGU) and maximum LAD (other guidelines), the number of cSI patients without risk factors with recommendation for surveillance would be only  n  = 77 (50%, CI [42.9, 57.6]) and  n  = 29 (19%, CI [13, 24.7]), respectively. In axial LAD, only 17 (11%, CI [7.1, 14.9]) patients, and in maximum LAD, only 7 (5%, CI [1.9, 6.5]) patients would be classified as cSI with risk factors. Substantially more patients would be diagnosed as metastasized with cSIIA/B ( n  = 60; 39%, CI [32.5, 46.1] and  n  = 118; 77%, CI [69.7, 83.1]) and therefore would be treated with 3× BEP, or for seminoma alternatively with 30/36 Gy  radiotherapy. In summary, stage-appropriate therapy would hypothetically require 34 optional cycles of chemotherapy (BEP or Carboplatin) for axial SAD (RECIST 1.1) compared to 361 for maximum LAD (other guidelines) ( Table S2 ). Again, the differences between RECIST 1.1 and SWENOTECA or DGU and SWENOTECA or DGU and the other guidelines presented a medium effect size according to Cohen ( p  < 0.001, r = 0.37, respectively). Meanwhile, the difference between RECIST 1.1 and the other guidelines showed a large effect size according to Cohen ( p  < 0.001, r = 0.72). Significant differences were observed across the three groups (correct staging and correct treatment, overstaging/overtreatment, understaging/undertreatment) depending on the different lymph node measurements ( p  < 0.001), as summarized in  Figure 2 . By using axial SAD, most patients would be treated appropriately ( n  = 127; 82%, CI [76.9, 87.7]). In contrast, based on maximum LAD, the fewest patients would be treated correctly ( n  = 57; 37%, CI [30.5, 44.2]). Overtreatment would occur in axial SAD, axial LAD and maximum LAD in 0%; 31%, CI [24.7, 38.3] and 61%, CI [53.9, 67.5] ( p  < 0.001), while undertreatment would affect 18%, CI [12.3, 22.7]; 10%, CI [5.8, 14.3] and 2%, CI [0, 4.5] of the patients, respectively, ( p  < 0.001). We examined the histological risk factors such as tumor size and rete testis invasion in seminoma patients, while LVI was assessed in NSGCT patients. We compared patients with and without relapse. Among seminoma patients, only tumor size was significantly larger in those who experienced relapse compared to those who remained relapse-free ( p  = 0.026). The other parameters did not show substantial differences. In binary logistic regression analysis, a significant correlation was observed between tumor size and relapse in seminoma patients ( p  = 0.031). For each unit increase in tumor size, the relative relapse probability increased by 3.3%, with a weak effect size (Cohen’s f 2  = 0.09). No significant association was found between LVI and relapse risk in NSGCT patients."

        "section_name": "4. Discussion",
        "content": "Our study population was representative regarding OS, age, time to relapse and histology [ 15 , 16 , 17 ]. Only relapse rate in NSGCT was lower than expected compared to other studies with 13% instead of the anticipated 15–50% [ 15 , 18 ]. Regarding seminoma, the 20% relapse rate fell in the expected range of 5–30% [ 19 , 20 , 21 ]. In NSGCT, histological risk factors were less present (LVI = 13%) than in seminoma patients (rete testis infiltration and testicular tumor size = 26%), which might explain the lower relapse rate in the NSGCT cohort. According to current guideline recommendations, the number of cS ≥IIA cases and overtreatment was considerably higher when measuring maximum LAD, as proposed by EAU, ESMO, AJCC and onkopedia, or maximum LAD in axial plane, as recommended by SWENOTECA and DGU, compared to SAD in axial plane, as recommended by RECIST 1.1. “Undertreated” patients with a delayed relapse diagnosis, mostly based on SAD measurement, could still be adequately treated with similar survival rates [ 20 , 22 ]. In the event of a higher clinical stage at delayed relapse diagnosis, these patients would only potentially receive a higher toxicity of chemo- or radiotherapy (one more cycle of BEP, if IGCCCG ≥ intermediate, or 36 Gy  instead of 30 Gy , only in seminoma if cSIIB instead of cSIIA). In contrast, initial false-positive patients, mainly based on LAD measurement, would be treated with unnecessary chemotherapy (at least 3× BEP) or radiotherapy (30 Gy  or 36 Gy ) [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. To date, this is the first study to examine the differences in cS and treatment based on the inconsistent staging recommendations across various guidelines. Therefore, we propose standardizing guidelines, to provide the best possible ratio between over- and underdiagnosis, balancing the risk between unnecessary acute and long-term therapeutic toxicity and relapse for the mostly young GCT patients [ 23 ]. Given the OS rate of 100% in our cohort, the axial SAD, as recommended by RECIST 1.1, might be the most appropriate parameter for lymph node staging, as it resulted in the lowest rate of overtreatment without increasing the rate of recurrence. RECIST 1.1 is the established radiological guideline in other oncological diseases for the evaluation of lymph nodes, leading to consistent diagnostic and therapeutic results [ 9 , 24 ]. While it does not seem applicable to treatment monitoring of new targeted tumor therapies, it remains the standard recommendation for staging and follow-up of conventional chemo- and radiotherapeutic therapies [ 25 ]. In addition, using an already established radiological parameter could be more suitable for hospitals that are not specialized in treating GCT. The threshold value ≥ 10 mm in axial SAD is also commonly used for primary lymph node staging in various other oncological diseases, and in men’s most common tumors: prostate-, lung- and colorectal cancer. However, its diagnostic reliability is well discussed due to its low sensitivity [ 26 , 27 , 28 ]. For diagnostic enhancement in these tumors, other criteria in addition to the lymph node size, such as radioligand imaging, were adapted and are nowadays standardly used [ 29 , 30 ]. However, the therapeutic consequences of cross-sectional imaging differ substantially between the aforementioned tumors and GCT. While those tumors predominantly refer to histopathological assessment of regional lymph nodes that have been resected in primary surgery to determine possible adjuvant therapy, GCT depends on accurately analyzing retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis in cross-sectional imaging for staging and treatment [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. Yet, cross-sectional imaging as a diagnostic tool has its limitations in accuracy for staging. Therefore, further approaches for adequate risk stratification and individualized therapy for patients have been established. For cSI, there are well-known histological risk factors: for seminoma tumor size > 4 cm and rete testis invasion; for NSGCT LVI. Our results revealed a significant association only between tumor size and the occurrence of relapse in seminoma patients, suggesting that established risk factors provide only an approximation of optimal relapse prediction. Consequently, recent studies have sought to refine prognostic models by incorporating additional factors to better stratify patients and once again, reduce overtreatment [ 31 , 32 ]. Furthermore, the combination of radiological staging and serum tumor markers might enhance diagnostic reliability of GCT [ 33 ]. Since conventional serum tumor markers have only limited sensitivity and specificity, extensive research into new tumor markers for GCT has been conducted in recent decades. A relatively new approach is measuring microRNA (miR)-371a-3p levels as a biomarker in serum. Its sensitivity and specificity are superior to conventional serum tumor markers (>90% vs. 50%) and it correlates strongly with tumor burden and cS of GCT (except teratoma) [ 34 , 35 ]. Furthermore, it is a promising diagnostic tool concerning the early detection of recurrence during follow-up of GCT patients [ 35 , 36 ]. However, it is not yet established in clinical practice. Another attempt to reduce overtreatment in marker-negative NSGCT cSIIA patients is the re-staging imaging after six weeks. According to the current EAU guideline, GCT patients should be treated like cSI, if the lymph node metastases decrease. If the metastases remain stable, further staging should be completed after six weeks; if the metastases remain unchanged, primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) should be performed. Chemotherapy should be applied if the tumor markers are positive or if the tumor progresses to cSIIB [ 3 ]. Moreover, in patients with low-volume metastatic cSIIA/B seminoma, ongoing research into primary RPLND seeks to spare patients the need for chemotherapy [ 37 ]. Staging imaging in GCT can also be enhanced through Radiomics, a machine learning algorithm that predicts lymph node metastasis by analyzing large imaging databases [ 38 ]. In particular, the combined “radiomics-clinical model,” which incorporates additional clinical factors, appears to outperform “radiomics-only” prediction models [ 38 ]. It should be noted that those Radiomics studies focusing on initial staging imaging in GCT, lack histological confirmation of lymph node metastasis. Nevertheless, a study evaluating Radiomics for predicting malignant retroperitoneal lymph nodes prior to RPLND in NSGCT, which included histological validation, also highlighted Radiomics as a promising diagnostic tool [ 39 ]. Remarkably, some GCT studies fail to provide specific definitions of the planes and dimensions employed for their radiological lymph node measurements, which were used for clinically staging their study cohort [ 15 , 17 , 19 , 34 ]. This lack of standardization in study protocols raises doubts about the overall comparability of prior GCT studies at specified cS. Differing lymph node size criteria in other oncological studies were also the main reason to implement RECIST 1.1 as a standardized reference, which has already demonstrated its value by ensuring consistent diagnosis, treatment and comparability in clinical trials for patients across different studies [ 24 ]. Adapting staging criteria in international guidelines also has ethical implications. On the one hand, understaging may lead to preventable harm for the patients, due to an insufficient initial evaluation of their disease, compromising their prognosis and well-being. On the other hand, overstaging may result in overtreatment by causing avoidable harm when the disease could have been managed with less aggressive approaches. In general, a physician should discuss all benefits and risks of different treatment options, so patients are properly informed and can accept or refuse any recommended medical treatment [ 40 ]. As understaging in GCT patients is very likely to result in similar survival rates [ 20 , 22 ], we regard it as the preferable option for these patients. However, borderline cases, such as patients with an axial SAD of 10 mm ± 2 mm, could be monitored more closely with earlier follow-up imaging, similar to the approach used for NSGCT patients with questionable cSI. Our study’s retrospective design and the limited sample size ( n  = 154) present certain limitations. Therefore, this study should be viewed primarily as hypothesis-generating, providing a basis for further research. A prospective multicenter study with a larger study cohort, corresponding to a robust power analysis, is essential to draw definitive conclusions for clinical practice and, ultimately, to contribute to the adaptation of international guidelines. Due to our inclusion criteria, axial SAD < 10 mm as maximum for the lymph node size and no adjuvant therapy after orchiectomy, the study cohort is possibly biased in favor of patients with an overall better prognosis. Possibly, patients with generally “smaller” and therefore more benign lymph nodes were included. Moreover, some patients with risk factors who received adjuvant therapy after initial staging were excluded. This would predominantly apply to NSGCT patients as they have a higher risk of recurrence at cSI than seminoma patients. These factors might have influenced our findings regarding relapse rates, particularly in relation to our limited cohort size. However, these inclusion criteria should be maintained in future prospective studies, though patient selection biases would be minimized in such a design. Yet, our cohort is contemporary and representative, because a variety of different lymph node sizes was analyzed. We even included patients with lymph nodes ≥10 mm in cross-sectional imaging in all measurements but the axial SAD measurement. Additionally, most relapses were diagnosed only radiologically and not by histological evaluation, as is commonplace in clinical practice."

        "content": "Our study reveals that inconsistency in current guidelines leads to very different clinical stages and treatment recommendations in GCT patients. There is an urgent need for lymph node measurement standardization to reduce avoidable acute and long-term therapeutic toxicity. Considering the OS rate of 100% and a non-elevated relapse rate in our cohort, using axial SAD as recommended by RECIST 1.1 resulted in the lowest rate of overtreatment. Consequently, this method may represent the best approach for a consistent lymph node staging. As our study was only exploratory, standardization of guideline recommendations requires further investigation through a prospective multicenter study."

    "abstract": "Introduction In testicular cancer, late relapse of teratoma with somatic‐type malignancy is rare and associated with a poor survival. A case of retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis of teratoma with somatic‐type malignancy 18 years after initial treatment for testicular cancer is reported. Case presentation A 46‐year‐old man had a 15‐mm‐sized mass in the para‐aortic region 18 years after initial treatment for testicular cancer, without elevated serum alfa‐fetoprotein or human chorionic gonadotropin levels. Laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was performed. The pathological findings showed teratoma with somatic‐type malignancy, and the findings of primary testicular cancer reported a yolk sac tumor, not teratoma. Conclusion Late relapse of teratoma with somatic‐type malignancy was resected by laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Therefore, long‐term follow‐up should be considered if patients with small retroperitoneal masses did not undergo retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, and early detection and surgical resection for relapse might be effective.",

Three cycles of multi‐agent chemotherapy consisting of BEP were administered, but a growing mass was found in the right lung. One cycle of BEP was added, followed by resection of the mass by video‐assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The pathological findings also showed a yolk sac tumor. Thereafter, the patient was followed up without additional treatment. Eight years after the initial treatment, the patient was referred to another hospital due to relocation. CT showed a mass, 8 × 4 mm in the para‐aortic region. After that, serum AFP, hCG, and LDH levels and/or CT were evaluated once a year.

LR is rare in patients with non‐seminoma. 4  However, the longest time to LR was reported to be 33.1 years. 7  Ehrlish  et al . reported, with median follow‐up of 15 years without RPLND of 141 patients with non‐seminoma who achieved normalization of serum tumor markers and radiographic remission (residual mass <1 cm) after induction chemotherapy, 12 patients had relapse, and 2 (1.4%) experienced LR beyond 10 years. 10  The pathological types were germ cell tumors with elevated AFP in 2 patients. Nason  et al . also reported that, of 191 patients with normal markers and residual masses (≤1 cm) after chemotherapy, 3 patients (1.6%) relapsed beyond 10 years (189, 262, and 336 months). 11  The pathological types were teratoma in 2 patients with normal markers and adenocarcinoma in 1 patient with abnormal markers. Interestingly, the presence of teratoma in orchiectomy specimen and the retroperitoneal mass size before chemotherapy were not predictors of relapse in non‐seminoma. 10  The present case did not contain teratoma in the orchiectomy specimen and did not receive RPLND on initial treatment. Recently, the efficacy of abdominal MRI, which could replace CT during follow‐up of TC survivors to reduce radiation exposure, was reported. 12  Therefore, long‐term follow‐up using CT or MRI might be considered if patients with small residual retroperitoneal masses did not undergo RPLND. Teratoma with STM is relatively rare, accounting for approximately 2% to 8% of TCs. 7 ,  13 ,  14  The frequency of teratoma with STM increased in LR, accounting for 44% beyond 5 years after initial treatment. 7  Teratoma with STM was frequently found in the retroperitoneum, as well as in the testis. Necchi  et al . showed that, of 48 patients with teratoma with STM, teratoma with STM occurred in the retroperitoneum in 46%. 15  In addition, the occurrence sites of teratoma with STM were the primary tumors in 35% and the resected metastatic sites in 50%. They also reported that 10–45% of teratoma with STM occurred in the metastatic masses even without teratoma in the primary tumor. 15  In the present case, the primary TC did not contain teratoma, but the retroperitoneal mass was teratoma with STM. The prognosis of teratoma with STM was worse than that of non‐seminoma without. According to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group classification, the 5‐year OS was 96%, 89%, and 67% in non‐seminoma patients with good, intermediate, and poor prognosis, respectively. 16  In contrast, the 5‐year OS was 69.8%, 49.1%, and 47.9% in good, intermediate, and poor prognosis patients with teratoma with STM, respectively. 17  Even for clinical stage I patients with teratoma with STM, the 5‐year OS was 83.4%. Micrometastases were considered to be a cause of the poor prognosis. Giannatempo  et al . reported that 28 clinical stage I patients with teratoma with STM underwent RPLND, and 10 patients had viable nodal teratoma with STM. 17  In addition, patients with teratoma with STM at LR had a significantly worse prognosis. 14  Chemotherapy had a limited effect on teratoma with STM, and patients with non‐resectable lesions might have poor survival. Che  et al . proposed surgical resection of tumor with LR if a complete resection was feasible in patients with teratoma with STM. 18  In the present case, a mass with teratoma with STM was resected at LR by L‐RPLND, and this prevented unnecessary chemotherapy. Moreover, the patient's ejaculatory function was preserved after L‐RPLND. Since sexual functioning including ejaculation disorders after RPLND has an impact on sexual activity and health‐related quality of life of TC survivors, 19 ,  20  more attention needs to be paid to postoperative sexual functioning if the metastatic mass is resectable."

    "title": "Sperm DNA methylome abnormalities occur both pre- and post-treatment in men with Hodgkin disease and testicular cancer",
    "abstract": "Background Combination chemotherapy has contributed to increased survival from Hodgkin disease (HD) and testicular cancer (TC). However, questions concerning the quality of spermatozoa after treatment have arisen. While studies have shown evidence of DNA damage and aneuploidy in spermatozoa years following anticancer treatment, the sperm epigenome has received little attention. Our objectives here were to determine the impact of HD and TC, as well as their treatments, on sperm DNA methylation. Semen samples were collected from community controls (CC) and from men undergoing treatment for HD or TC, both before initiation of chemotherapy and at multiple times post-treatment. Sperm DNA methylation was assessed using genome-wide and locus-specific approaches. Results Imprinted gene methylation was not affected in the sperm of HD or TC men, before or after treatment. Prior to treatment, using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450 K) arrays, a subset of 500 probes was able to distinguish sperm samples from TC, HD and CC subjects; differences between groups persisted post-treatment. Comparing altered sperm methylation between HD or TC patients versus CC men, twice as many sites were affected in TC versus HD men; for both groups, the most affected CpGs were hypomethylated. For TC patients, the promoter region of  GDF2  contained the largest region of differential methylation. To assess alterations in DNA methylation over time/post-chemotherapy, serial samples from individual patients were compared. With restriction landmark genome scanning and 450 K array analyses, some patients who underwent chemotherapy showed increased alterations in DNA methylation, up to 2 to 3 years post-treatment, when compared to the CC cohort. Similarly, a higher-resolution human sperm-specific assay that includes assessment of environmentally sensitive regions, or “dynamic sites,” also demonstrated persistently altered sperm DNA methylation in cancer patients post-treatment and suggested preferential susceptibility of “dynamic” CpG sites. Conclusions Distinct sperm DNA methylation signatures were present pre-treatment in men with HD and TC and may help explain increases in birth defects reported in recent clinical studies. Epigenetic defects in spermatozoa of some cancer survivors were evident even up to 2 years post-treatment. Abnormalities in the sperm epigenome both pre- and post-chemotherapy may contribute to detrimental effects on future reproductive health.

        "content": "Therapeutic advances in the field of oncology have allowed for an increase in the number of cancer survivors. However, the treatments used for effectively curing patients of their disease do not target cancer cells alone, but also adversely affect normal cells. Male germ cells are particularly susceptible to anticancer drugs due to the ongoing division of spermatogonial stem cells and continued production of mature spermatozoa following puberty; any possible negative impacts to the sperm cell may have implications for the next generation. Of particular interest are the survivors of Hodgkin disease (HD) and testicular cancer (TC), since they are often diagnosed at a young age. With a greater than 95% 5-year survival rate of adolescents and young adults for these two diseases [ 1 ,  2 ], concerns about fertility and the possibility of parenthood are particularly relevant [ 3 ,  4 ]. There are a number of studies showing genetic defects in spermatozoa, as well as more recent evidence of epigenetic abnormalities, following chemotherapy treatments [ 5 ,  6 ]; with this come questions regarding the possible impact of exposed germ cells to future generations. In a previous study, we reported increases in aneuploidy in the spermatozoa of HD and TC patients [ 7 ]. In the same cohort, increased sperm DNA damage, altered chromatin quality and decreased DNA compaction were found [ 8 – 10 ]. In these studies, abnormalities were found prior to the onset of treatment and remained up to 24 months after the termination of chemotherapy. Interestingly, studies have demonstrated that the risk of fathering offspring with a major congenital abnormality is increased in men with a history of cancer, even if the children were conceived prior to diagnosis and treatment, and this increase does not seem to diminish even years after treatment was given [ 11 – 13 ]. Thus, it is possible that both the cancer and its treatment may adversely affect male germ cells. Animal models can help separate out effects of anticancer drug treatment from those of the underlying cancers being treated in humans. In one study, in which male rats were treated using similar drug regimens to those used in human TC patients, survival of offspring sired from these rats was found to be significantly reduced [ 14 ]. As well, there were increased DNA damage [ 15 ] and altered gene expression [ 16 ] in germ cells post-treatment. In the same model, altered sperm DNA methylation was detected immediately after the termination of combination chemotherapy treatments [ 17 ]. These studies indicate that along with persistent genetic and/or DNA damage in sperm, anticancer drugs used in human TC can result in sperm epigenetic alterations, in a rodent model, where there were also detrimental effects of the paternal treatment on the offspring. DNA methylation, the most well-studied epigenetic mark, involves the covalent addition of a methyl group onto the cytosine ring. This modification occurs at 80% of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome and is involved in a number of cellular processes including transcriptional repression, X-inactivation and chromatin stability. Proper establishment of genomic imprinting, the monoallelic expression of genes in a parent-of-origin manner, also involves DNA methylation, with key events of demethylation and remethylation occurring in developing germ cells. Imprinted genes have important roles in embryonic growth and development, placental function and postnatal behavior [ 18 – 21 ]. The importance of DNA methylation is underscored by the role this epigenetic modification plays in different disease states. Abnormal expression of imprinted genes has been implicated in several developmental disorders including the Beckwith–Wiedemann, Silver Russell and Angelman syndromes [ 22 ,  23 ]. Aberrant DNA methylation has also been implicated in human infertility but remains controversial; altered methylation of imprinted loci has been reported in some studies examining human spermatozoa from men presenting with infertility and decreased sperm counts [ 24 ,  25 ], while other found no such associations [ 26 ]. Furthermore, genome-wide hypomethylation, as well as abnormal methylation of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes, are all  hallmarks of cancer progression [ 27 ,  28 ]. With roles in cancer, as well as evidence of DNA methylation alterations associated with infertility and intergenerational effects [ 29 ,  30 ], our aim was to assess the sperm DNA methylation patterns in a cohort of HD and TC patients as well as a cohort of community control subjects (CC). The present study was designed to investigate the impact of HD and TC, as well as their treatments, on sperm DNA methylation patterns. Using several approaches to study genome-wide and locus-specific DNA methylation, our goals were to determine 1) whether abnormal germ cell DNA methylation patterns were present in patients prior to initiation of chemotherapy and 2) if, within the same patient, patterns of sperm DNA methylation were altered as a result of their cancer treatment, as well as over time post-treatment."

Table  1  provides patient characteristics of these subjects at baseline, prior to initiation of chemotherapy.

With the 450 K array, several probes are located within the germline imprinting control regions (ICRs) of numerous imprinted genes. We therefore extracted and averaged the beta-values/methylation of the probes within each ICR of individual imprinted genes from all the participants prior to and following treatment (Fig.  1  and Additional file  1 : Table S1). We examined methylation of the ICRs of  H19 ,  MEST ,  KCNQ1OT1  and  SNRPN , genes previously reported to be altered in male infertility and/or regions known to have roles in imprinting disorders. For all four genes, there were no differences between the baseline samples for the CC, HD and TC groups (Fig.  1 A-D, solid bars). Thus, for all pre-treatment sperm samples, high levels of methylation (> 85%) were found at the paternally methylated ICR of  H19 , while low levels (< 5%) were observed for the ICRs of the maternally methylated genes  MEST ,  KCNQ1OT1  and  SNRPN . Similarly, at all times post-chemotherapy treatment, normal levels of methylation/beta-value (Fig.  1 A–D, hatched bars) were found. Sperm DNA methylation levels of other imprinted genes found on the 450 K arrays also appeared normal and clustering based solely on imprinted gene methylation from all the samples was not able to distinguish the CC, HD and TC groups (Fig.  1 E). In conclusion, imprinted gene methylation was not affected in the sperm of HD or TC patients either before or after anticancer drug therapy. Fig. 1 Sperm DNA methylation of imprinted genes is not affected by time (CC men), disease (HD or TC men) or treatments (HD or TC men).

E  Clustering of the average beta-values across the ICR of the different imprinted genes analyzed using the 450 K array Sperm samples were examined prior to chemotherapy to determine if the underlying cancer had an impact on the sperm DNA methylome. The baseline samples were first studied using the 450 K arrays. Of the over 450,000 probes found on the array, we removed probes with multiple mapping to locations, as well as probes containing single nucleotide polymorphisms at a minor allele frequency of greater than 1%. Hierarchical clustering of the beta-values/methylation for the remaining 385,553 probes was not able to differentiate the cancer cohorts from that of CC (Fig.  2 A). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then applied to analyze the differences among the group means in the three different cohorts; this resulted in 11,525 probes with  p  values < 0.05 (Additional file  1 : Table S2). Hierarchical clustering from these sites was able to distinguish TC patients and, to a lesser extent, the HD patients from CC (Fig.  2 B). With clustering of the top 500 most significant probes, we were able to differentiate perfectly the three cohorts from one another (Fig.  2 C). To ensure that these results did not happen by chance, we randomly selected the same number of probes found to be significant following the three-group ANOVA and observed no similar grouping of samples (Additional file  2 : Fig. S1). These results demonstrate that a sperm DNA methylation signature, consisting of a subset of 450 K CpG sites, was able to distinguish HD and TC patients and CC subjects. Fig. 2 Sperm DNA methylation is capable distinguishing patients according to cancer diagnosis.

D  Significant probes/sites discovered were merged to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs), with  E  the top 10 DMRs containing the greatest number of merged probes/sites shown While probes represent individual CpG sites, we were interested to ascertain whether larger regions of altered methylation existed. To do so, we merged the significantly altered sites found within 1 kb of each other in order to obtain differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Of the 11,525 total sites discovered by ANOVA, a large majority of the sites remained isolated: 9248 single sites, representing 80.2% of the total sites (Fig.  2 D). Despite this large proportion of isolated CpGs, DMRs were discovered, resulting in 973 merged regions. TopGO was used to look at gene ontology (GO) focusing on biological processes using the DMRs; the top 20 most significant terms are presented in Additional file  2 : Fig. S2A, and all significant terms can be found in Additional file  3 . Many terms pertaining to nervous system/synaptic signals as well as gene expression were discovered. The DMRs were then sorted according to the number of ANOVA significant sites, and the top 10 are listed (Fig.  2 E). The large region found within the promoter and intronic elements of the transcript variant 3, of the spondin 2,  SPON2,  gene and the long non-coding RNA LOC100130872 (Fig.  3 A) contains 20 sites (Fig.  3 B,  C , shaded box). Differential methylation can be observed between the three cohorts, with HD and TC patients possessing the highest and lowest averaged beta-value/methylation across the entire region, respectively. These results suggest that, beyond individual CpG sites, there are regions in the genome that are able to differentiate CC, HD and TC subjects using their sperm DNA methylation patterns.

Mean ± SEM, * p  < 0.05 DNA methylation of the same baseline sperm samples was examined with a second approach, restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS), a technique that examines approximately 3000 loci in the human genome. RLGS produces large two-dimensional gels where each locus is represented by a spot (Additional file  2 : Fig. S3A); by overlapping gels, we are able to observe differences in methylation by the appearance (hypomethylation), disappearance (completely hypermethylation) or changes in spot intensity. Using a single CC patient as a reference (CC7), we compared all other sperm baseline samples from all other patients and found that many loci were altered in methylation (Additional file  2 : Fig. S3B); however, no cancer-specific locus was observed when comparing all the HD and/or TC samples to the reference (i.e., locus specifically in cancer cohorts compared to CC). As RLGS analysis only allows loci differing in methylation between samples by more than 25% to be detected, the results suggest that large differences in methylation do not distinguish the 3 groups from one another using this technique. Next, we used the 450 K data to determine whether there were sites of differential methylation between specific cancer types (HD or TC) when compared with the CC group. Using post hoc Tukey’s testing, following our initial ANOVA analysis, a total of 3265 significantly altered probes were found between the HD and CC cohorts (Fig.  4 A and Additional file  1 : Table S3); more than twice the number of probes, 7760, were discovered for the TC cohort (Fig.  4 C and Additional file  1 : Table S4). For both cancer types, the majority of the differentially methylated sites demonstrated hypomethylation; 2277 sites (69.7%) showed lower methylation in the HD cohort, while 4904 sites (63.2%) were found in the TC cohort as compared to the CC.

A list of the top 10 DMRs found from  B  HD and  D  TC containing the greatest number of merged probes/sites Similar to the analyses above, cancer-specific DMRs were also identified. Once again, the majority of CpGs were single sites; 3112 and 6661 single sites (representing 93.3% and 84.2% of total significant sites) for the HD and TC groups, respectively, when compared to the CC group (Fig.  4 A,  C ). When compared to the 68 DMRs for the HD cohort, greater than sevenfold more (493 DMRs) were found to be different between the TC and CC subjects. When looking at all DMRs together or with hyper- and hypomethylated DMRs separately, many biological processes related to immune system/response and development were found to be significantly enriched in the HD cohort (Additional file  2 : Fig. S2B and Additional file  3 ). For the TC cohort, many GO terms related to development were found to be enriched (Additional file  2 : Fig S2C and Additional file  3 ); interestingly, biological processes related to sexual/male reproduction were also discovered. A list of the top 10 regions with the most CpG sites is shown for HD and TC (Fig.  4 B and  D , respectively). For HD DMRs, the largest region, containing the most sites (9 sites), was located in the  SPON2  gene, in the same region found through three-group ANOVA (Fig.  3 ). One large region, common to both the HD and TC cohorts, was found overlapping the non-coding RNA for the pseudogene brain-abundant, membrane-attached signal protein 1 pseudogene 1,  BASP1P1  (Additional file  2 : Fig. S4A). All 450 K array probes within the vicinity of the pseudogene were found to be affected in at least one of the cancer cohorts, with lower levels of sperm DNA methylation observed in both compared with CC (Additional file  2 : Figs. S4B and S4C). For the TC group, the largest region that demonstrated differential methylation was found within the promoter–transcription start site (TSS) of the growth differentiation factor 2,  GDF2  (Fig.  5 A). For 450 K array probes in  GDF2 , 11 out of 12 CpG sites covered were found to differentiate our cohorts through ANOVA (Fig.  5 B and  C , shaded box); of those sites, 6 were determined to be altered between TC and CC cohorts following post hoc Tukey’s testing (Fig.  5 C). The altered DNA methylation was validated through several bisulfite pyrosequencing assays, which examined a total of 21 CpGs (Fig.  5 D). All 21 CpGs examined showed decreased methylation (~ 20%) in TC patients compared to CC (Fig.  5 E). Taken together, these results suggest that cancer-specific CpG sites and regions exist for HD and TC patients as compared to CC. While the 450 K array examines only a limited number of CpG sites within a given genomic feature, larger areas of differential methylation may exist that distinguish the different cohorts.

Mean ± SEM;  p  < 0.05 * Next, we examined the effect of chemotherapy on sperm DNA methylation. All CC subjects had at least one time point available following their baseline collection. Conversely, not every cancer patient had samples available for analysis with the 450 K array due to insufficient spermatozoa/DNA post-treatments (HD: 4 patients; TC: 3 patients). Principal component analysis (PCA) using the data from all probes demonstrated that samples from each individual patient had a tendency to group together (Additional file  2 : Fig. S5A); however, there are some subjects in which their post-treatments sample was found to be further away from their baseline sample (discussed further below). Three different genome-wide DNA methylation assays were used to assess the impact of anticancer drug treatment on human sperm. Samples collected from individual patients were compared directly to their own baseline (pre-treatment) sample. For 450 K array data, a cutoff of greater than 0.2 beta-value change (~ 20% methylation) was chosen, similar to the 25% cutoff used for the RLGS approach. Examination of the different time points demonstrated both hyper- and hypomethylation; the total number of sites showing altered methylation for each individual subject using RLGS or the 450 K array is listed in Additional file  2 : Fig. S5B-C, respectively. By RLGS, CC individuals showed few loci with altered methylation over time (Fig.  6 A, left panel); an average of 12 spots were changed when looking at samples collected at 6, 12 and 18 months compared to baseline. For the cancer survivors, most had an above average number of changes post-chemotherapy (Fig.  6 A, right panel); the greatest number of changes, with 50 (~ fourfold increase), was observed for a HD patient, 6 months following treatment (HD3-1). By 450 K array, CC individuals demonstrated on average 145 sites with altered methylation at 6, 12 and 18 months (Fig.  6 B, left panel). Compared to this cohort, half of the men undergoing treatment (HD2-1, HD3-1 and TC2-1) demonstrated 20-fold higher alterations in DNA methylation at 6 months post-chemotherapy (Fig.  6 B, right panel). While most patients showed similar levels to CC patients at later time points, one HD patient still demonstrated altered sperm DNA methylation at 12 and 24 months (HD2-2 and 4). Samples where an increased number of changes were observed are the same samples that were found to be further away in the PCA from their baseline timepoint (Additional file  2 : Fig. S5A). Taken together, our initial results indicate that in some cancer survivors higher than pre-treatment DNA methylation defects in sperm are present, even up to 2 years post-treatment.

The panel targets all sites on Illumina’s MethylationEPIC array (850 K), but also examines CpGs of intermediate levels of methylation (20–80% methylated) found to possess greater variability in human sperm DNA and be susceptible to environmental effects; we refer to the latter as dynamic CpG sites. We hypothesized that the human sperm-specific MCC-Seq panel might be more sensitive than the 450 K array at detecting altered DNA methylation at later time points post-treatment. The capture panel was used to examine two CC and one each of the HD and TC patients. While no baseline time points were available for further analyses, we analyzed samples collected 12 and 18 months post-chemotherapy (time points 2 and 3) and determined the number of differences between these two times, for each subject. With a minimum tenfold coverage, a total of 1,711,875 CpG sites were commonly sequenced between all the samples. Using a similar cutoff as the techniques above, we found that the CC patients had a total of 39,656 and 38,383 CpG sites which demonstrated a minimum 20% difference in methylation; the HD and TC patients both had an elevated number of altered sites, with 53,011 and 48,882 CpGs, respectively (Fig.  6 C). In all patients, the number of hypo- and hypermethylation events was similar. Interestingly, a vast majority of the sites found to be different between 12 and 18 months were found in the dynamic sites (hatched bars); on average 82.9% of the changes occurring were at dynamic CpGs. The total number of sites altered from each subject was also expressed as a percentage of all the CpGs analyzed (Fig.  6 D); a significantly larger proportion of CpGs was altered in cancer patients as compared to the CC subjects ( p  < 0.0001, chi-squared test with Yate’s correction). The use of the MCC-Seq approach provides further evidence that DNA methylation defects may persist at later time points post-treatment (12–18 months). We next wanted to examine how alterations in sperm DNA methylation behave over time post-treatment, within individual cancer patients, using the 450 k array data. Venn diagrams were created to depict the alterations in the sperm DNA methylome for cancer patients for whom several time points post-treatment were available (Fig.  7 A). A preponderance of changes in DNA methylation at the initial 6-month follow-up were specific to this time point. Examining patterns in sperm DNA methylation for these sites across all collection periods, we see that, compared to baseline, hypo- and hypermethylation are observed at 6 months following chemotherapy and that these patterns return to near normal levels at subsequent time points (Fig.  7 B). Fig. 7 Altered sperm DNA methylation in cancer patients demonstrates mainly acute changes, with some patients showing common alterations and persistent changes over time.

Dashed vertical line,  p  = 0.05 For patients HD2 and HD3, where a large number of sites were affected at 6 months, we asked whether common sites were affected between patients. A total of 1234 CpGs were altered in both patients, representing ~ 25% of DMCs from each patient; these individual sites were merged into 225 DMRs (Fig.  7 C, right). TopGO analysis of these regions revealed a number of significant biological processes, many relating to brain and overall development as well as neurobiology (Fig.  7 C, left and Additional file  3 ). Next, while most changes following treatment appeared to be resolved after the 6-month time point, we asked whether some altered sites persisted over time. For patient HD2, a total of 256 sites were found in common at all the collection times post-chemotherapy (6, 12 and 24 months, Fig.  7 A). GO analysis of these sites, found that many biological processes involved in development as well as terms related to the nervous system were significantly enriched (Fig.  7 D and Additional file  3 ). Taken together, while the majority of the defects in sperm DNA methylation patterns immediately following chemotherapy appear to be resolved, common changes due to treatment for HD were identified. These changes and those found to persist up to 2 years post-treatment are related to processes important for development and the nervous system. We postulated that the pre-treatment differences in sperm methylation between the three groups might have resulted from the underlying cancer and would likely disappear post-treatment. To determine if any of the pre-treatment differences between the groups persisted post-treatment, we examined a single sample from each cancer survivor, where the number of altered probes/sites from the 450 K array was similar to that of the CC post-chemotherapy, in an attempt to minimize the effects seen by chemotherapy treatment. In examining the 11,525 significant probes discovered with our baseline (pre-treatment) three-group ANOVA, hierarchical clustering still segregated the TC survivor patients from the HD and CC cohorts post-chemotherapy (Fig.  8 A). Using the top 500 significant probes, there was an even better distinction of the three cohorts (Fig.  8 B). We next took the 450 K array data from all subjects/patients, regardless of the degree of altered methylation post-treatment, and examined the methylation of DMRs that had shown altered methylation pre-treatment between the different cancer groups. We examined the individual probes discovered through ANOVA, highlighting those specifically altered following post hoc Tukey’s testing, and examined the averaged methylation throughout the region. No significant difference is observed between CC subjects at baseline and at their time points afterwards for the three genes analyzed (Fig.  8 C-E and Additional file  2 : Fig. S6). In contrast, the  BASP1P1  locus demonstrated significantly lower methylation in all cancer patients at all time points (Fig.  8 C and Additional file  2 : Fig. S6A). For the region spanning  SPON2 /LOC100130872, HD patients at baseline and post-treatment showed significantly higher levels of methylation (Fig.  8 D). Looking at individual CpGs, all sites, including those not significant following post hoc Tukey’s testing, showed increased sperm DNA methylation in HD subjects at all time points (Additional file  2 : Fig. S6B). For the  SPON2 /LOC100130872 region, TC patients showed a nonsignificant decrease at baseline ( p  = 0.23), which became significant post-treatment. Similarly, within the promoter-TSS region of  GDF2,  TC subjects demonstrated decreased average methylation post-treatment (Fig.  8 E) and all sites across the region possessed lower methylation, as well (Additional file  2 : Fig. S6C); this latter result is in line with our pyrosequencing validation which revealed the decreased methylation at many CpG sites across the locus. Taken together, these results indicate that sperm samples collected post-chemotherapy treatment in survivors show persistent differential methylation. Fig. 8 Sperm DNA methylation of samples post-chemotherapy treatment can still distinguish subjects from each other.

The patient characteristics of these samples are shown in Additional file  1 : Table S5. Sperm samples from 6 CC subjects and 12 TC patients, 6 samples each collected at 2 and 3 years post-chemotherapy, were obtained, and bisulfite pyrosequencing was used to assay the same 21 CpG sites within  GDF2 . The average methylation across the locus was similar for the two groups (55.71% and 54.17% for CC and TC, respectively). However, there was more variability in  GDF2  methylation among the TC patients, particularly at 2 years post-treatment, where 2 of the 6 patients showed low levels of methylation across the locus (Fig.  9 A). Variability in  GDF2  methylation decreased but remained significant at 3 years post-treatment (Fig.  9 B).

        "content": "As key events of erasure and reestablishment of DNA methylation of imprinted genes occur in male germ cells during their development, we first examined this category of genes as a preliminary indication of the impact of HD and TC and their treatment on sperm. With the 450 K array, several probes are located within the germline imprinting control regions (ICRs) of numerous imprinted genes. We therefore extracted and averaged the beta-values/methylation of the probes within each ICR of individual imprinted genes from all the participants prior to and following treatment (Fig.  1  and Additional file  1 : Table S1). We examined methylation of the ICRs of  H19 ,  MEST ,  KCNQ1OT1  and  SNRPN , genes previously reported to be altered in male infertility and/or regions known to have roles in imprinting disorders. For all four genes, there were no differences between the baseline samples for the CC, HD and TC groups (Fig.  1 A-D, solid bars). Thus, for all pre-treatment sperm samples, high levels of methylation (> 85%) were found at the paternally methylated ICR of  H19 , while low levels (< 5%) were observed for the ICRs of the maternally methylated genes  MEST ,  KCNQ1OT1  and  SNRPN . Similarly, at all times post-chemotherapy treatment, normal levels of methylation/beta-value (Fig.  1 A–D, hatched bars) were found. Sperm DNA methylation levels of other imprinted genes found on the 450 K arrays also appeared normal and clustering based solely on imprinted gene methylation from all the samples was not able to distinguish the CC, HD and TC groups (Fig.  1 E). In conclusion, imprinted gene methylation was not affected in the sperm of HD or TC patients either before or after anticancer drug therapy.

        "content": "Sperm samples were examined prior to chemotherapy to determine if the underlying cancer had an impact on the sperm DNA methylome. The baseline samples were first studied using the 450 K arrays. Of the over 450,000 probes found on the array, we removed probes with multiple mapping to locations, as well as probes containing single nucleotide polymorphisms at a minor allele frequency of greater than 1%. Hierarchical clustering of the beta-values/methylation for the remaining 385,553 probes was not able to differentiate the cancer cohorts from that of CC (Fig.  2 A). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then applied to analyze the differences among the group means in the three different cohorts; this resulted in 11,525 probes with  p  values < 0.05 (Additional file  1 : Table S2). Hierarchical clustering from these sites was able to distinguish TC patients and, to a lesser extent, the HD patients from CC (Fig.  2 B). With clustering of the top 500 most significant probes, we were able to differentiate perfectly the three cohorts from one another (Fig.  2 C). To ensure that these results did not happen by chance, we randomly selected the same number of probes found to be significant following the three-group ANOVA and observed no similar grouping of samples (Additional file  2 : Fig. S1). These results demonstrate that a sperm DNA methylation signature, consisting of a subset of 450 K CpG sites, was able to distinguish HD and TC patients and CC subjects. Fig. 2 Sperm DNA methylation is capable distinguishing patients according to cancer diagnosis.

D  Significant probes/sites discovered were merged to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs), with  E  the top 10 DMRs containing the greatest number of merged probes/sites shown While probes represent individual CpG sites, we were interested to ascertain whether larger regions of altered methylation existed. To do so, we merged the significantly altered sites found within 1 kb of each other in order to obtain differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Of the 11,525 total sites discovered by ANOVA, a large majority of the sites remained isolated: 9248 single sites, representing 80.2% of the total sites (Fig.  2 D). Despite this large proportion of isolated CpGs, DMRs were discovered, resulting in 973 merged regions. TopGO was used to look at gene ontology (GO) focusing on biological processes using the DMRs; the top 20 most significant terms are presented in Additional file  2 : Fig. S2A, and all significant terms can be found in Additional file  3 . Many terms pertaining to nervous system/synaptic signals as well as gene expression were discovered. The DMRs were then sorted according to the number of ANOVA significant sites, and the top 10 are listed (Fig.  2 E). The large region found within the promoter and intronic elements of the transcript variant 3, of the spondin 2,  SPON2,  gene and the long non-coding RNA LOC100130872 (Fig.  3 A) contains 20 sites (Fig.  3 B,  C , shaded box). Differential methylation can be observed between the three cohorts, with HD and TC patients possessing the highest and lowest averaged beta-value/methylation across the entire region, respectively. These results suggest that, beyond individual CpG sites, there are regions in the genome that are able to differentiate CC, HD and TC subjects using their sperm DNA methylation patterns.

RLGS produces large two-dimensional gels where each locus is represented by a spot (Additional file  2 : Fig. S3A); by overlapping gels, we are able to observe differences in methylation by the appearance (hypomethylation), disappearance (completely hypermethylation) or changes in spot intensity. Using a single CC patient as a reference (CC7), we compared all other sperm baseline samples from all other patients and found that many loci were altered in methylation (Additional file  2 : Fig. S3B); however, no cancer-specific locus was observed when comparing all the HD and/or TC samples to the reference (i.e., locus specifically in cancer cohorts compared to CC). As RLGS analysis only allows loci differing in methylation between samples by more than 25% to be detected, the results suggest that large differences in methylation do not distinguish the 3 groups from one another using this technique."

Using post hoc Tukey’s testing, following our initial ANOVA analysis, a total of 3265 significantly altered probes were found between the HD and CC cohorts (Fig.  4 A and Additional file  1 : Table S3); more than twice the number of probes, 7760, were discovered for the TC cohort (Fig.  4 C and Additional file  1 : Table S4).

A list of the top 10 DMRs found from  B  HD and  D  TC containing the greatest number of merged probes/sites Similar to the analyses above, cancer-specific DMRs were also identified. Once again, the majority of CpGs were single sites; 3112 and 6661 single sites (representing 93.3% and 84.2% of total significant sites) for the HD and TC groups, respectively, when compared to the CC group (Fig.  4 A,  C ). When compared to the 68 DMRs for the HD cohort, greater than sevenfold more (493 DMRs) were found to be different between the TC and CC subjects. When looking at all DMRs together or with hyper- and hypomethylated DMRs separately, many biological processes related to immune system/response and development were found to be significantly enriched in the HD cohort (Additional file  2 : Fig. S2B and Additional file  3 ). For the TC cohort, many GO terms related to development were found to be enriched (Additional file  2 : Fig S2C and Additional file  3 ); interestingly, biological processes related to sexual/male reproduction were also discovered. A list of the top 10 regions with the most CpG sites is shown for HD and TC (Fig.  4 B and  D , respectively). For HD DMRs, the largest region, containing the most sites (9 sites), was located in the  SPON2  gene, in the same region found through three-group ANOVA (Fig.  3 ). One large region, common to both the HD and TC cohorts, was found overlapping the non-coding RNA for the pseudogene brain-abundant, membrane-attached signal protein 1 pseudogene 1,  BASP1P1  (Additional file  2 : Fig. S4A). All 450 K array probes within the vicinity of the pseudogene were found to be affected in at least one of the cancer cohorts, with lower levels of sperm DNA methylation observed in both compared with CC (Additional file  2 : Figs. S4B and S4C). For the TC group, the largest region that demonstrated differential methylation was found within the promoter–transcription start site (TSS) of the growth differentiation factor 2,  GDF2  (Fig.  5 A). For 450 K array probes in  GDF2 , 11 out of 12 CpG sites covered were found to differentiate our cohorts through ANOVA (Fig.  5 B and  C , shaded box); of those sites, 6 were determined to be altered between TC and CC cohorts following post hoc Tukey’s testing (Fig.  5 C). The altered DNA methylation was validated through several bisulfite pyrosequencing assays, which examined a total of 21 CpGs (Fig.  5 D). All 21 CpGs examined showed decreased methylation (~ 20%) in TC patients compared to CC (Fig.  5 E). Taken together, these results suggest that cancer-specific CpG sites and regions exist for HD and TC patients as compared to CC. While the 450 K array examines only a limited number of CpG sites within a given genomic feature, larger areas of differential methylation may exist that distinguish the different cohorts.

        "content": "Next, we examined the effect of chemotherapy on sperm DNA methylation. All CC subjects had at least one time point available following their baseline collection. Conversely, not every cancer patient had samples available for analysis with the 450 K array due to insufficient spermatozoa/DNA post-treatments (HD: 4 patients; TC: 3 patients). Principal component analysis (PCA) using the data from all probes demonstrated that samples from each individual patient had a tendency to group together (Additional file  2 : Fig. S5A); however, there are some subjects in which their post-treatments sample was found to be further away from their baseline sample (discussed further below). Three different genome-wide DNA methylation assays were used to assess the impact of anticancer drug treatment on human sperm. Samples collected from individual patients were compared directly to their own baseline (pre-treatment) sample. For 450 K array data, a cutoff of greater than 0.2 beta-value change (~ 20% methylation) was chosen, similar to the 25% cutoff used for the RLGS approach. Examination of the different time points demonstrated both hyper- and hypomethylation; the total number of sites showing altered methylation for each individual subject using RLGS or the 450 K array is listed in Additional file  2 : Fig. S5B-C, respectively. By RLGS, CC individuals showed few loci with altered methylation over time (Fig.  6 A, left panel); an average of 12 spots were changed when looking at samples collected at 6, 12 and 18 months compared to baseline. For the cancer survivors, most had an above average number of changes post-chemotherapy (Fig.  6 A, right panel); the greatest number of changes, with 50 (~ fourfold increase), was observed for a HD patient, 6 months following treatment (HD3-1). By 450 K array, CC individuals demonstrated on average 145 sites with altered methylation at 6, 12 and 18 months (Fig.  6 B, left panel). Compared to this cohort, half of the men undergoing treatment (HD2-1, HD3-1 and TC2-1) demonstrated 20-fold higher alterations in DNA methylation at 6 months post-chemotherapy (Fig.  6 B, right panel). While most patients showed similar levels to CC patients at later time points, one HD patient still demonstrated altered sperm DNA methylation at 12 and 24 months (HD2-2 and 4). Samples where an increased number of changes were observed are the same samples that were found to be further away in the PCA from their baseline timepoint (Additional file  2 : Fig. S5A). Taken together, our initial results indicate that in some cancer survivors higher than pre-treatment DNA methylation defects in sperm are present, even up to 2 years post-treatment.

The panel targets all sites on Illumina’s MethylationEPIC array (850 K), but also examines CpGs of intermediate levels of methylation (20–80% methylated) found to possess greater variability in human sperm DNA and be susceptible to environmental effects; we refer to the latter as dynamic CpG sites. We hypothesized that the human sperm-specific MCC-Seq panel might be more sensitive than the 450 K array at detecting altered DNA methylation at later time points post-treatment. The capture panel was used to examine two CC and one each of the HD and TC patients. While no baseline time points were available for further analyses, we analyzed samples collected 12 and 18 months post-chemotherapy (time points 2 and 3) and determined the number of differences between these two times, for each subject. With a minimum tenfold coverage, a total of 1,711,875 CpG sites were commonly sequenced between all the samples. Using a similar cutoff as the techniques above, we found that the CC patients had a total of 39,656 and 38,383 CpG sites which demonstrated a minimum 20% difference in methylation; the HD and TC patients both had an elevated number of altered sites, with 53,011 and 48,882 CpGs, respectively (Fig.  6 C). In all patients, the number of hypo- and hypermethylation events was similar. Interestingly, a vast majority of the sites found to be different between 12 and 18 months were found in the dynamic sites (hatched bars); on average 82.9% of the changes occurring were at dynamic CpGs. The total number of sites altered from each subject was also expressed as a percentage of all the CpGs analyzed (Fig.  6 D); a significantly larger proportion of CpGs was altered in cancer patients as compared to the CC subjects ( p  < 0.0001, chi-squared test with Yate’s correction). The use of the MCC-Seq approach provides further evidence that DNA methylation defects may persist at later time points post-treatment (12–18 months)."

Venn diagrams were created to depict the alterations in the sperm DNA methylome for cancer patients for whom several time points post-treatment were available (Fig.  7 A). A preponderance of changes in DNA methylation at the initial 6-month follow-up were specific to this time point. Examining patterns in sperm DNA methylation for these sites across all collection periods, we see that, compared to baseline, hypo- and hypermethylation are observed at 6 months following chemotherapy and that these patterns return to near normal levels at subsequent time points (Fig.  7 B).

A total of 1234 CpGs were altered in both patients, representing ~ 25% of DMCs from each patient; these individual sites were merged into 225 DMRs (Fig.  7 C, right). TopGO analysis of these regions revealed a number of significant biological processes, many relating to brain and overall development as well as neurobiology (Fig.  7 C, left and Additional file  3 ). Next, while most changes following treatment appeared to be resolved after the 6-month time point, we asked whether some altered sites persisted over time. For patient HD2, a total of 256 sites were found in common at all the collection times post-chemotherapy (6, 12 and 24 months, Fig.  7 A). GO analysis of these sites, found that many biological processes involved in development as well as terms related to the nervous system were significantly enriched (Fig.  7 D and Additional file  3 ). Taken together, while the majority of the defects in sperm DNA methylation patterns immediately following chemotherapy appear to be resolved, common changes due to treatment for HD were identified. These changes and those found to persist up to 2 years post-treatment are related to processes important for development and the nervous system."

        "content": "We postulated that the pre-treatment differences in sperm methylation between the three groups might have resulted from the underlying cancer and would likely disappear post-treatment. To determine if any of the pre-treatment differences between the groups persisted post-treatment, we examined a single sample from each cancer survivor, where the number of altered probes/sites from the 450 K array was similar to that of the CC post-chemotherapy, in an attempt to minimize the effects seen by chemotherapy treatment. In examining the 11,525 significant probes discovered with our baseline (pre-treatment) three-group ANOVA, hierarchical clustering still segregated the TC survivor patients from the HD and CC cohorts post-chemotherapy (Fig.  8 A). Using the top 500 significant probes, there was an even better distinction of the three cohorts (Fig.  8 B). We next took the 450 K array data from all subjects/patients, regardless of the degree of altered methylation post-treatment, and examined the methylation of DMRs that had shown altered methylation pre-treatment between the different cancer groups. We examined the individual probes discovered through ANOVA, highlighting those specifically altered following post hoc Tukey’s testing, and examined the averaged methylation throughout the region. No significant difference is observed between CC subjects at baseline and at their time points afterwards for the three genes analyzed (Fig.  8 C-E and Additional file  2 : Fig. S6). In contrast, the  BASP1P1  locus demonstrated significantly lower methylation in all cancer patients at all time points (Fig.  8 C and Additional file  2 : Fig. S6A). For the region spanning  SPON2 /LOC100130872, HD patients at baseline and post-treatment showed significantly higher levels of methylation (Fig.  8 D). Looking at individual CpGs, all sites, including those not significant following post hoc Tukey’s testing, showed increased sperm DNA methylation in HD subjects at all time points (Additional file  2 : Fig. S6B). For the  SPON2 /LOC100130872 region, TC patients showed a nonsignificant decrease at baseline ( p  = 0.23), which became significant post-treatment. Similarly, within the promoter-TSS region of  GDF2,  TC subjects demonstrated decreased average methylation post-treatment (Fig.  8 E) and all sites across the region possessed lower methylation, as well (Additional file  2 : Fig. S6C); this latter result is in line with our pyrosequencing validation which revealed the decreased methylation at many CpG sites across the locus. Taken together, these results indicate that sperm samples collected post-chemotherapy treatment in survivors show persistent differential methylation.

        "content": "Hodgkin disease and testicular cancer are two forms of cancers that are commonly diagnosed in men of young reproductive age. While treatments result in high survival rates, questions about fertility and the possibility of fathering children post-treatment are of particular concern. Are there negative impacts due to the disease state itself and/or caused by the chemotherapy treatments that can affect the sperm? Can these have implications for the next generation? This study adds to previous work, including reports from our group, demonstrating an increased incidence of aneuploidy, DNA damage and altered chromatin quality in human sperm up to 2 years following combination chemotherapy treatments for HD and TC [ 7 – 10 ]. Our findings here reveal distinct DNA methylation patterning in sperm prior to the onset of treatment that are able to distinguish HD, TC and CC subject groups from one another; interestingly, these profiles between the different groups remained post-treatment. As well, by comparing baseline and post-chemotherapy samples, while most initial defects appear to be resolved at later time points, altered sperm DNA methylation was detected in patients up to 18–24 months post-treatment, indicating that treatment-induced epigenetic abnormalities, like genetic damage, persist long after patients become disease free. Imprinted genes acquire sperm-specific DNA methylation patterns during male germ cell development and play crucial roles in normal development; disturbances in genomic imprinting can lead to a number of disorders [ 32 ]. We analyzed the methylation of several imprinted genes represented on the 450 K arrays and found normal profiles in the sperm of men diagnosed with HD or TC, prior to, and following, combination chemotherapy treatments. Our pre-treatment results are in keeping with those of a recent study examining the DNA methylation status of imprinted genes in cryopreserved sperm samples from normospermic before treatment seminoma patients and control subjects, where no alterations in imprinted gene methylation were found [ 33 ]. The absence of imprinted gene DNA methylation abnormalities in testicular cancer patients prior to treatment in two different studies is reassuring. We are not aware of studies that have compared imprinted gene methylation in patients before and after treatment. However, we previously examined effects of human testicular cancer treatment regimens (BEP) on sperm DNA methylation in a rat model [ 17 ]. Similar to our human studies, imprinted gene methylation was not affected by the BEP treatment. In a post-treatment genome-wide study of sperm DNA methylation in adult patients 10 years after pubertal exposure to chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, no imprinting gene methylation abnormalities were reported [ 6 ]. The study presented here is novel, in that we were able to examine the human sperm DNA methylome in samples acquired prior to the initiation of treatment and follow the same patients at several time points post-chemotherapy. Our results with the 450 K arrays demonstrated that, prior to treatment, sperm DNA methylation signatures are present in men and are able to distinguish HD and, to a greater extent, TC patients from CC subjects. Interestingly, these group-specific DNA methylation patterns persisted in sperm following chemotherapy, up to the 3.5-year the period studied. Pre-treatment signatures were not evident using the lower resolution RLGS method. RLGS examines DNA methylation at a relatively small number of loci compared to the 450 K arrays and can only reproducibly detect larger changes in DNA methylation, greater than 25% in magnitude. Similar to our findings, sperm aneuploidy has also been detected in pre-treatment samples from testicular cancer and Hodgkin disease patients [ 7 ,  34 ]. Explanations for the presence of pre-treatment signatures include the impact of a cancer environment on germline stem cells, underlying genetic susceptibility, and an altered somatic environment. Recent studies examining the incidence of birth defects in the children of men with cancer, support the potential clinical relevance of the presence of pre-treatment genetic and epigenetic alterations in the spermatozoa of cancer patients [ 13 ]. While studying sperm aneuploidy is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise, genome-wide DNA methylation assays are more widely accessible and may facilitate the screening of pre-treatment spermatozoa for prospective studies. Our study suggests that pre-treatment DNA methylation differences between groups can persist post-treatment. In support of the finding in our prospective cohort, validation of a locus found to be altered in TC patients also showed greater variation in an external cohort, where samples were collected 2–3 years following chemotherapy. The most likely explanation would be persistence of abnormal germline stem cells or spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in the testis post-treatment. SSCs that had been quiescent may not have been eliminated by the chemotherapy. That SSCs with abnormal DNA methylation patterns can persist in the testis for many years is supported by a study of osteosarcoma patients treated as adolescents and examined as adults [ 6 ]. Although pre-treatment samples were not available for the latter study, altered DNA methylation patterns were found in spermatozoa 10 years after pubertal exposure to chemotherapy. The pre-treatment aberrant epigenetic marks found in the sperm of HD and TC patients may identify a preexisting signature that could be used to screen patients. Indeed, both diseases have etiologies associated with altered epigenetic patterning. The distinctive cells used for the diagnosis of HD, the Hodgkin/Reed–Sternberg cells, have been shown to have lost or decreased many of the B cell-specific gene expression profiles [ 35 ,  36 ]. By altering DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation patterning, studies in cell lines have been able to alter the expression patterns of B cells to resemble more closely those characteristics of HD, and vice versa [ 37 – 39 ]. Testicular cancer, hypospadias, cryptorchidism and poor semen quality, are included in the clinical entity, testicular dysgenesis syndrome, a disorder postulated to be due to environmental effects that disrupt embryonic and fetal germ cell development [ 40 ,  41 ]. Indeed, the precursor of testicular germ cell tumors, intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN) cells, has been theorized to originate from fetal gonocytes, through morphological and gene expression profiling [ 42 ,  43 ]. Epigenetic marks of the ITGCN have also been demonstrated to be similar to those of fetal germ cells [ 44 ,  45 ], allowing for increased proliferative activity. Interestingly, biological processes relating to the immune system/immune response and sexual/male reproduction were observed in the differentially methylated regions from the baseline analysis of the HD and TC cohorts, respectively, alluding to the origins of these diseases. While the altered epigenetic signatures from our patient cohorts were discovered in sperm, it remains to be determined whether more accessible biological samples, such as blood or saliva, would also carry perturbed epigenetic patterning. From cancer studies, methylation of loci identified in both HD and TC patient sperm are known to influence gene expression. The largest differentially methylated region found in HD patients was within the  SPON2  locus, showing increased methylation in HD versus CC individuals. Altered methylation within the promoter of this extracellular matrix protein has been observed both in prostate cancer and in cancer-associated myofibroblast cell lines from gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas compared to normal tissues [ 46 ,  47 ]. Decreased methylation within the promoter led to a corresponding increase in  SPON2  expression within the cell lines, which was also detected in patients with the poorer prognosis and survival of gastric/colorectal carcinoma patients [ 48 ,  49 ]. Specific to testicular cancer, decreased methylation in sperm was observed within the promoter of  GDF2  in our patient cohort, a result also seen in a subset of TC patients 2–3 years post-treatment in the validation cohort. This locus encodes the GDF2 protein, also known as bone morphogenic protein 9 (BMP9), a member of the TGFβ superfamily, which has roles in cancer progression [ 50 ]. Specifically, GDF2 activation of SMAD1/5 signaling has been found to enhance cell death in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines; treatment of these cells with 5-azacytidine, a potent demethylating agent, demonstrated decreased methylation of the  GDF2  locus, increased signaling and higher sensitivity to cell death [ 51 ]. This same study also observed higher  GDF2  promoter methylation in tumors of ovarian cancer patients compared to normal individuals. Similarly, loss of  GDF2/BMP9 , in a mouse model of breast cancer, was associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis, indicating a protective role of this gene [ 52 ]. From the cancer studies, the increased methylation of  SPON2  in the sperm of HD patients would result in decreased expression, while the decreased methylation of  GDF2  in the sperm of the TC patients would result in increased expression. We hypothesize that such altered expression patterns, perhaps involving other genes identified in the HD and TC cohorts, may provide a growth or differentiation advantage for germ cells. Immediately following chemotherapy treatments, many patients in the HD and TC cohorts showed an elevated number of sites with altered sperm DNA methylation compared to the CC groups. Indeed, a significant increase in DNA damage, as measured by tail extent moment (Comet assay), was detected in a similar group of both HD and TC patients 6 months after treatments [ 9 ]. We also observed that many of the initial defects observed were resolved and the number of altered sites diminished with time, similar to the treatment-induced damage to sperm chromatin structure being differentially repaired over time in cancer survivors. However, one patient demonstrated increased alterations in the sperm methylome in the following 2 years; similar significant sperm DNA damage and low DNA compaction have been observed up to 24 months post-treatment [ 10 ]. It is also intriguing that developmental and nervous system pathways were enriched in examining our post-treatment effects for GO biological process terms. Taken together, alterations in sperm DNA methylation, altered sperm chromatin structure and DNA damage can be observed in HD and TC patients prior to and up to several years following chemotherapy regimens. This damage to the genetic/epigenetic cargo of spermatozoa may help to explain the observed increased risk of congenital abnormalities in children fathered by men with a history of cancer, whether the offspring were conceived prior to or years following treatments [ 11 ,  12 ]. One limitation of our study is the small number of patients available in each cohort, as well as the reduced numbers of samples available following treatments. While these are common forms of cancers in men of reproductive age, the incidence is still low, with 2.8 and 6.8 per 100,000 in the United States for HD and TC, respectively [ 53 ,  54 ]. As well, the impact of treatments on spermatogenesis is evident with decreased sperm counts immediately following chemotherapy, which only return to pre-treatment levels after 24 months [ 55 ]. Despite the low patient numbers in our different cohorts, we were able to detect differential methylation signatures in sperm. As mentioned previously, a validation in other cohorts of HD and TC patients of these signatures would be beneficial. Another limitation is that we were only able to examine a subset of the ~ 32.8 million possible CpG methylation sites found in the human genome [ 56 ]. The majority of the results presented here are from the Illumina 450 K array, examining approximately 450,000 CpG sites, with these mainly covering CpG islands and over gene regions. Our early study examining sperm DNA methylation using the 450 K array, showed that the majority of CpGs interrogated (86% of probes) were hypo- or hypermethylated (< 20% or > 80%, respectively) with methylation levels conserved between individuals; only a small proportion of probes (0.3%) were variable between individuals and demonstrated intermediate (20–80%) methylation [ 57 ]. We reported similar finding (i.e., a minority of variable CpG sites) in a more recent study using the 450 K array and examining the effects of low dose folic acid supplementation on sperm DNA methylation [ 58 ]. Our use of the human sperm-specific MCC-Seq that examines 3.18 million sites, did demonstrate a greater number of alterations in patients who underwent chemotherapy treatments; the vast majority of the altered DNA methylation was found in dynamic CpGs, sites of intermediate methylation and not well covered on the different Illumina arrays. Indeed, the use of our sperm-specific panel for the analysis of human DNA methylation differences due to a genetic polymorphism, environmental exposures, as well as the process of aging, has demonstrated that differential methylation is mainly found in these novel dynamic CpG sites targeted [ 31 ,  59 ]. Future studies using our human sperm targeted panel, or with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, may be useful to examine in greater detail the effect of cancer as well as their treatments on the sperm methylome."

Following treatments, we observed higher levels of methylation defects, which decreased over time. However, similar to observed DNA damage, in some patients, these defects persisted up to 2 years following treatment. Using a targeted human sperm capture sequencing technique, differences in sperm DNA methylation were observed in novel dynamic CpG sites, which warrants further investigation. Our findings emphasize the importance of collecting pre-treatment samples in future studies and may help explain increases in birth defects reported in cancer patients both before and after their treatment."

        "content": "Semen samples were obtained from a cohort of subjects with non-seminoma testicular cancer (TC, stages II–III,  n  = 7) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HD, stage II–IV,  n  = 7) who underwent combination chemotherapy and no radiation therapy treatments; TC patients were treated with 2–4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy (bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin) and HD patients underwent 4–8 cycles of ABVD treatments (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Collection time points from these individuals were at baseline ( t  = 0), prior to initiation of chemotherapy, and at 6 months intervals ( t  = 1, 2, 3, etc.), up to 3.5 years, after termination of treatments. Due to dropout and/or azoospermia, samples could not be obtained throughout the post-chemotherapy period for all patients. A cohort of healthy untreated community control (CC,  n  = 8) volunteers was also recruited. The CC subjects had no significant past medical history or history of infertility. All CC, HD and TC subjects were non-smokers and were part of a larger cohort of subjects, where studies examining sperm quality and damage over time and following chemotherapy treatments were previously conducted [ 8 ,  9 ]. The baseline samples from the CC cohort were included as a post mandatory folic acid fortification group in a previous study of ours [ 58 ]. Sperm from men in all groups were collected during the same time period; the men would have been exposed to folic acid fortification in their diets, due to the mandatory addition of this vitamin to white flour and enriched grain products in 1998; no additional folic acid supplementation was given to any of the cohorts. Semen samples were collected by masturbation, with a minimum of 3 days abstinence and allowed to liquefy at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C in the absence of cryo-protectant. Samples from an Italian validation cohort, were also collected in a similar fashion. Here, TC patient survivors who had undergone 1–4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy were recruited and samples collected 2 or 3 years after termination of treatments ( n  = 6–3 seminoma and 3 non-seminoma, per time point); six control samples from this cohort were also examined. The study was approved by the different institutional ethics review boards and informed consent was obtained from all subjects (see Declarations). Semen samples were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min in order to obtain sperm pellets. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8; 150 mM EDTA, pH 8; 100 mM DTT) and high molecular weight DNA isolated by Proteinase K digestion and phenol–chloroform extraction, as described previously [ 60 ]. Precipitated DNA was allowed to dissolve in TE buffer (10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8; 1 mM EDTA) for 1 week before proceeding with DNA methylation analyses. Several techniques were used for the assessment of DNA methylation. Initial analysis relied on restriction landmark genomic scanning, RLGS [ 60 ]. Briefly, DNA samples (CC,  n  = 8; HD,  n  = 7; TC,  n  = 6) were digested with the methylation sensitive restriction enzyme, NotI. Following this, radioactive end-labeling of overhangs was performed, proceeded by further digestion of samples with EcoRV. DNA fragments were electrophoresed on a first dimension agarose gel and in situ digestion with a third restriction enzyme, Hinf1, was carried out. Samples were finally run on a second dimension acrylamide gel, resulting in the final RLGS profile. Profiles were imaged on phosphorimaging plates and film. Films were visually assessed and a scoring system previously described was used for analysis [ 61 ]. Illumina’s Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip (450 K) array was used in order to assess the methylation at over 480,000 CpGs dinucleotides of CC ( n  = 8), HD ( n  = 7) and TC ( n  = 7) subjects. The assay was conducted by Genome Quebec at the McGill University Innovation Centre using a protocol previously described [ 62 ]. Briefly, ~ 500 ng of DNA was bisulfite converted using an EZ DNA methylation Kit (Zymo Research), followed by whole-genome amplification, enzymatic fragmentation and hybridization to the BeadChip. Arrays were imaged on the Illumina iScan, resulting in raw data files in IDAT format. The annotation of the 450 K array to determine the genomic location of probes was determined with IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19 (version 0.6.0) [ 63 ]. Preprocessing of the raw data files (IDAT), quality control (QC) assessment and normalization were performed using the R package minfi [ 64 ], with normalization based on the study by Fortin et al. [ 65 ]. The QC demonstrated that a single sample from a CC patient (CC7-2) clustered separately from other samples and failed due to lower median intensities (Additional file  2 : Fig. S7A, red arrow). PCA of raw and normalized data was also carried out using the R package shiny methyl (version 1.22.0) [ 66 ]. This analysis indicated that the same sample failing QC was an outlier of PC2 (Additional file  2 : Fig. S7B, red arrow); as well, three other samples (one CC and two TC; CC8-0, TC7-0 and TC7-1; blue arrows) appeared to be outliers within PC1. We examined whether these samples were possibly contaminated, by examining the imprinted gene methylation. The three samples were identified as outliers through PCA analysis, which demonstrated deviation in methylation across all germline ICRs analyzed to a similar extent; this would indicate somatic cell contamination (Additional file  1 : Table S1). Hierarchical clustering of the averaged methylation from all ICRs of imprinted genes demonstrated that the failed QC sample as well as the outliers clustered clearly apart (Additional file  2 : Fig. S7C); therefore, all these (along with any other post-treatment samples) were removed from further analysis, leaving an  n  = 7 for the CC and HD cohorts and an  n  = 6 for the TC cohort. Our recently developed human sperm-specific capture panel [ 31 ] was used to assess over 3 million CpG sites within the genome of 8 samples: two CC and one each HD and TC at times 2 and 3 following chemotherapy treatment. Using 1 µg of DNA from each sample, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) library preparation and targeting bisulfite sequencing were performed as described previously [ 67 ,  68 ]. Briefly, DNA was sonicated to obtain 300–400 bp fragments, proceeded by DNA-end repair, 3’-end adenylation, adaptor ligation and clean up, according to the KAPA High Throughput Library Preparation kit protocol (Roche/KAPA Biosystems). Samples were then bisulfite converted using the EpiTect Fast DNA bisulfite kit (Qiagen) followed by 9–12 cycles of PCR amplification. The final WGBS libraries were purified using Agencourt AMPure Beads (Beckman Coulter) and were then enriched using our human sperm-specific panel, using the SeqCap Epi Enrichment System protocol developed and optimized by Roche NimbleGen. Equal amounts of the multiplexed WGBS libraries (84 ng each) were combined and hybridized to the human sperm-specific capture panel at 47 °C for 72 h. The captured libraries were washed, recovered and PCR-amplified before final purification was conducted. The final capture libraries were sequenced in a single lane of the Illumina HiSeq4000 system using 100-bp paired end sequencing. Raw reads from the sequencers were processed using pipelines developed at the McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre (MUGQIC), as part of the GenAP project ( https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/genpipes ). Common CpG sites from all samples, with > 10 × coverage, were retained. Bisulfite pyrosequencing was used to validate differential methylation at the promoter region of  GDF2 . Here, baseline sperm DNA samples prior to any treatments were analyzed from CC ( n  = 8) and TC ( n  = 5) cohorts of our main study, as well the Italian validation cohort. For pyrosequencing assays, sperm DNA (200–500 ng) underwent bisulfite conversion with the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers were designed (PyroMark Assay Design 2.0, Qiagen) to overlap the areas where differential methylation was observed following 450 K array analysis; two sets of PCR primers, using a total of five sequencing primers, were designed in order to analyze a total of 21 CpG sites (Additional file  1 : Table S6). Bisulfite PCR was conducted, and pyrosequencing was performed as previously described [ 69 ] using the PyroMark Q24 kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The R environment and language (version 3.5.2) were used to perform statistical computing and graphing of the of 450 K array data. Specifically, graphical heatmaps and hierarchical clustering, as well as ANOVA and post hoc Tukey’s tests, were conducted using RStudio (version 1.2.1335). Significant probes within 1000 bp were merged using the merge function of BEDtools (version 2.29.0) to determine DMRs. Other graphs were generated, and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 6.01. Unpaired t tests were performed to compare the mean sperm DNA methylation of each CpG analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing, as well as the averaged normalized beta-value across the different DMRs. GO term enrichment was performed using the R package topGO (version. 2.42.0). Chi-squared with Yates’ correction was applied to compare the frequency of CpG sites having > 20% methylation changed, as measured by MCC-Seq, in cancer patients compared to the individual CC subjects. Unless otherwise specified, statistical significance was set at  p  < 0.05 for the different analyses."

Collection time points from these individuals were at baseline ( t  = 0), prior to initiation of chemotherapy, and at 6 months intervals ( t  = 1, 2, 3, etc.), up to 3.5 years, after termination of treatments. Due to dropout and/or azoospermia, samples could not be obtained throughout the post-chemotherapy period for all patients. A cohort of healthy untreated community control (CC,  n  = 8) volunteers was also recruited. The CC subjects had no significant past medical history or history of infertility. All CC, HD and TC subjects were non-smokers and were part of a larger cohort of subjects, where studies examining sperm quality and damage over time and following chemotherapy treatments were previously conducted [ 8 ,  9 ]. The baseline samples from the CC cohort were included as a post mandatory folic acid fortification group in a previous study of ours [ 58 ]. Sperm from men in all groups were collected during the same time period; the men would have been exposed to folic acid fortification in their diets, due to the mandatory addition of this vitamin to white flour and enriched grain products in 1998; no additional folic acid supplementation was given to any of the cohorts. Semen samples were collected by masturbation, with a minimum of 3 days abstinence and allowed to liquefy at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C in the absence of cryo-protectant. Samples from an Italian validation cohort, were also collected in a similar fashion. Here, TC patient survivors who had undergone 1–4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy were recruited and samples collected 2 or 3 years after termination of treatments ( n  = 6–3 seminoma and 3 non-seminoma, per time point); six control samples from this cohort were also examined. The study was approved by the different institutional ethics review boards and informed consent was obtained from all subjects (see Declarations)."

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives To explore the supportive care needs of cancer survivors, the characteristics of patients with high levels of unmet need, changes in unmet need after treatment ends and differences in unmet needs of breast, colorectal and testicular survivors. Methods The method used was a prospective longitudinal mailed survey. Unmet needs, measured by 25‐item modified Cancer Survivors Unmet Needs survey at baseline (immediately post‐treatment) and 8 months later, were analysed descriptively. Results Of 434 breast, 186 colorectal and 75 testicular patients responding at baseline, 56.2%, 65.6% and 50.7%, respectively, had no unmet needs, the top decile having ≥10 (breast) or seven (colorectal and testicular) different needs and seven different unmet needs. The most frequently reported unmet need (all groups) was fear of cancer recurrence. Unmet needs fell significantly at 8 months for breast patients. Some patients reported new needs. Needs were lowest amongst colorectal survivors and differed between the three groups. Higher levels of unmet needs (breast and colorectal) were associated with having had chemotherapy. Conclusion Most survivors reported few unmet needs, but a small proportion have persisting or emerging needs. Routine or regular monitoring of unmet needs is required so that healthcare professionals can deliver personalised care based on individual needs, preferences and circumstances.",

        "section_name": "INTRODUCTION",
        "content": "Improvements in early detection and more effective treatments have led to increased cancer survival rates in most regions of the world (Allemani et al.,  2018 ). However, this population of cancer survivors (Macmillan Cancer Support,  2017 ) may experience detrimental impacts on quality of life, psychological morbidity and unmet needs as a result of their cancer and treatment (Palmer et al.,  2017 ; Smith et al.,  2018 ). This paper focusses on unmet supportive care needs that were reported by breast, colorectal and testicular cancer survivors. The data were gathered as part of a larger study (Batehup et al.,  2017 ) that was conducted at a time when policy and practice regarding follow‐up after cancer treatment in the British National Health Service (NHS) was changing (Davies & Batehup,  2011 ). A shift was proposed from traditional hospital clinic‐based follow‐up for all patients to patient stratification, based on a clinical assessment of individual patient needs. Patients judged to have ongoing problems or complex conditions continued to receive clinic follow‐up whilst others are provided with information for self‐management and the opportunity to contact specialist nurses by telephone with their concerns and questions (patient triggered follow‐up). All usual surveillance tests continue ( http://www.evidence.nhs.uk/qipp ). This change was largely prompted by resourcing pressures in hospital outpatient departments that were increasing waiting times for cancer treatment (Davies & Batehup,  2011 ). Whilst there is little evidence that clinic follow‐up improves recurrence detection rates (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination,  2007 ; Kimman et al.,  2007 ; Montgomery et al.,  2007 ), concerns exist that removal or reduction of outpatient attendance may increase anxiety amongst survivors and result in their needs not being addressed (Chapman et al.,  2009 ). Hence, the unmet supportive care needs of survivors in three tumour groups within a large cancer centre in United Kingdom were evaluated to inform future service developments. Breast and colorectal pathways were selected because these are high volume services; testicular patients were added because they are an under‐researched group. Available evidence on unmet needs of cancer survivors is inconclusive (Harrison et al.,  2009 ; Harrison et al.,  2010 ; Willems et al.,  2015 ; Wylie et al.,  2013 ), and little comparative information is available. This paper reports findings from a study that aimed to improve understanding of unmet needs to inform practice through (1) an assessment of the prevalence of different types of unmet needs reported by breast, colorectal and testicular cancer survivors at completion of treatment and how these changed over the subsequent 8 months and (2) an investigation of the characteristics of survivors reporting high levels of unmet need so that support can be targeted. The study also enabled a comparison of the unmet needs of breast, colorectal and testicular survivors."

        "content": "A longitudinal survey of breast, colorectal and testicular cancer patients was carried out in two cohorts (before and after the introduction of patient triggered follow‐up) between April 2011 and August 2013. Salient details can be found elsewhere (Batehup et al.,  2017 ). Almost all (90%) of those in the patient triggered follow‐up cohort were receiving outpatient follow up at the start of the study so the cohorts were combined for the analysis. Researchers used a review of records, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments and multidisciplinary team meetings to identify patients aged 18 years and over who were coming to completion of treatment with curative intent and entering follow‐up. Permission was obtained from clinicians to approach their patients. Patients were excluded if they were unable to complete the necessary questionnaires or had a second cancer diagnosed during treatment. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants. Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the NHS Trust involved. Guidance from the National Research Ethics Service advised this was a service evaluation. The procedures in this study adhere to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Structured questionnaires were mailed to patients after final treatment (T0) and four (T1), eight (T2) and 12 (T3) months later. Three reminders were sent to non‐responders. Only responses at T0 and T2 are included in this paper. Participants' experience at these points reflect needs after primary treatment and over a period when awareness of emotional and psychosocial effects of cancer survivorship grows. Some participants recruited at the end of the project were not sent questionnaires at T2, and some questionnaires that were sent and returned were not analysed due to study time constraints, thereby reducing the sample size at T2. Participant demographics were collected at baseline, including gender, age, relationship status, education, employment status and comorbid conditions. Clinical information on treatments received, dates and recurrences, were extracted from clinical notes (with consent). Postcode was used to derive the Index of Multiple Deprivation (Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, Office of National Statistics, Index of Multiple Deprivation,  2015 ). Supportive care needs in the preceding month were measured at each time point using the Cancer Survivors Unmet Needs Survey (CaSUN) (Hodgkinson et al.,  2007 ). In its original form, it comprises 35 items, but following Willems et al. ( 2015 ) and Amatya et al. ( 2014 ), the study focused on the 28 items in five domains relating to need. Following piloting with patients, the 28 items were reduced to 25. Domains, items and scoring are described in Table  1 . Cancer survivors unmet supportive care needs survey Note : Response options for each item were as follows: Not applicable; No need; I have the need, but it is being met; Yes, I have the need and it is not being met (i.e., an unmet need). Three items were omitted from the 28 items assessing need: reference to car parking was removed from the Comprehensive Cancer Care domain because patients found it irrelevant. The two items comprising the Quality of Life domains were dropped because quality of life was measured by other instruments in the parent study. A new Coping domain was created with seven items from the 14 items Existential Survivorship domain. Unmet needs were rated Strong/Moderate/Weak. Scoring and interpretation of CaSUN was carried out according to published guidance (Hodgkinson et al.,  2007 ). As domains contain different numbers of items, the mean number of needs were analysed. Missing CaSUN items were recoded as follows for calculating domain and total unmet needs: within each of the five domains where at least one, but not all, items were completed, each missing item was set equal to the proportion of unmet needs amongst the non‐missing items in that domain. If only one domain had all items missing, each item was assigned the proportion of unmet needs amongst all non‐missing items in the other four domains. If two or more domains had all items missing, these domains and the total unmet needs were set as missing (irrespective of how many of the 25 items had been answered). Characteristics of patients were compared at T0 between the three cancer types and between those recruited in the two cohorts (pre and post the introduction of patient triggered follow‐up). Participants at T2 were compared with non‐responders. The total number of unmet needs (any strength) was aggregated (range 0–25; higher scores indicating more unmet needs) for each participant. Within each cancer type, unmet needs of any strength were aggregated by CaSUN domain, and domain totals were compared between tumour groups at T0. Individuals with the highest levels of unmet needs were defined through inspection of the distribution of the number of unmet needs (any strength) in each tumour group. These highest need individuals were identified at T0 and T2 and compared with the remainder of respondents regarding baseline socio‐demographic and clinical characteristics. Comparisons were conducted using tests appropriate to type of variable. Responses from patients who had participated both at T0 and T2 were analysed to assess the changes to unmet needs (any strength) between T0 and T2. Four categories of unmet needs were identified: persistent (present at T0 and T2), emergent (not present at T0, present at T2), resolved (present at T0, not present at T2) and none (neither present at T0 nor T2). Numbers and percentages were tabulated for each item, for each tumour site. Changes in the total unmet needs from T0 to T2 were reported as means with 95% confidence intervals; changes within tumour sites were assessed (paired  t  test). Statistical significance was reported at the 5% level throughout."

        "content": "Of 1410 breast, colorectal and testicular patients screened for the study, 1316 were eligible and sent baseline questionnaire. Of these, 948 (72%) were returned, and 878 (66.7%) analysed. A detailed recruitment table is shown in Figure  1 . Recruitment flow chart (April 2010 to August 2013) for all patients combined (breast, colorectal and testicular) Baseline characteristics of participants are shown in Table  2 . Amongst non‐clinical features, testicular cancer survivors, as compared with colorectal and breast participants were more likely to have had higher education (Kruskal–Wallis test:  p  = 0.001), were less likely to live alone (chi‐squared test:  p  = 0.045) and had fewer long standing illnesses (Kruskal–Wallis test:  p  < 0.001). Chemotherapy was more common amongst testicular survivors (81.6%) (breast 31.1%, colorectal 30.7%) (chi‐squared test:  p  < 0.001). Comparison of the characteristics of the two cohorts (pre and post the introduction of patient triggered follow‐up) found no difference. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants Completion of primary treatment (Baseline T0). Standard deviation. Amongst the 434 breast, 186 colorectal and 75 testicular cancer participants who completed all 25 CaSUN items, 56.2% (95% CI: 51.5% to 60.9%), 65.6% (95% CI: 58.7% to 72.5%) and 50.7% (95% CI: 39.1% to 62.2%), respectively, had no unmet needs at T0. The mean (SD) total number of unmet needs (any strength) at T0 was 2.74 (4.64) for breast, 1.71 (3.49) for colorectal and 2.01 (3.12) for testicular cancer. Most frequently reported unmet need for all tumour sites was fear of cancer recurrence (24.4% breast, 13.7% colorectal and 22.0% testicular) (Table  3 ). Changes in weak/moderate/strong unmet needs between T0 and T2 ranked according to the proportion with weak/moderate/strong unmet needs at T2, by tumour site INFO = Information, CCC = Comprehensive cancer care, ES = Existential survivorship, REL = Relationships, COPING = Coping. Ranks of CaSUN items: Cancer Survivors Unmet Needs questionnaire at Time 0 (T0) post completion of all curative treatments. Ranks of CaSUN items at Time 2 (T2), 8 months after T0.

Unmet needs absent at T0 and present at T2. Absence of unmet needs at both T0 and T2. Breast and testicular participants experienced significantly higher unmet needs over colorectal in the Existential Survivorship and Coping domains (Kruskal–Wallis test:  p  = 0.010, 0.003, respectively); there was no statistically significant difference in unmet needs across the tumour sites in the Information, Comprehensive Cancer Care and Relationships domains. Item analysis revealed that fear of cancer recurrence and managing stress (both Existential Survivorship domain) and coping with others' expectations and decision making about the future (both Coping domain) contributed to the higher unmet needs of breast and testicular participants. A statistically significant (chi‐square test : p  = 0.012) higher percentage of breast participants over colorectal and testicular experienced unmet need regarding adjustment to body changes (Existential Survivorship domain) (Table  3 ). Inspection of the distribution by tumour group suggested that the number of unmet needs fell off sharply below the top decile. This high need group comprised (to the closest whole number) 52 (10.2%) breast, 28 (12.2%) colorectal and 10 (12.0%) testicular. These participants had at least 10, 7 and 7 different unmet needs, respectively. Breast cancer participants in the high needs group (≥10 unmet needs), compared with the rest (<10), were significantly younger (mean [SD] 54.04 [10.11] vs. 61.55 [11.29] years; unpaired  t  test  p  < 0.0005), more likely to have received chemotherapy ( n  = 27, 51.9% vs.  n  = 136, 29.6%; chi‐square  p  = 0.001) and tended to be more highly educated (Mann–Whitney  U  test  p  = 0.104). Colorectal participants were also more likely to report high needs (≥7 vs. <7) if they had received chemotherapy ( n  = 14, 50.0% vs.  n  = 60, 29.7%, chi‐square  p  = 0.031). No other background characteristics were significantly associated with reporting high numbers of needs for any tumour site. Of the 540 breast, 251 colorectal and 87 testicular participants at T0, 312 (57.8%), 132 ( 52 .6%) and 41 (47.1%), respectively, responded promptly at T2, a total of 485 (Figure  1 ). There were no significant differences between respondents and non‐respondents on any baseline features, except amongst the colorectal patients where respondents reported a significantly higher level of education (data not shown). Amongst the 249 breast, 103 colorectal and 38 testicular participants who completed all 25 CaSUN items at T2, 163 (65.5%, 95% CI: 59.5% to 71.4%) breast, 74 (71.8%, 95% CI: 63.0% to 80.7%) colorectal and 23 (60.5%, 95% CI: 44.2% to 76.8%) testicular had no unmet needs. The mean (SD) total number of unmet needs (any strength) at T2 was 2.18 (4.52) breast, 1.38 (3.65) colorectal and 1.76 (3.88) testicular. The most frequently reported item for breast and testicular participants remained fear of cancer recurring (18.9% and 14.6% respectively). For colorectal participants, availability of local health services was the most frequently reported item (11.0%), fear of recurrence being fourth (9.2%) (Table  3 ). The need to “reduce the stress in my life” was ranked in second place at T0 by participants from all three tumour sites. Regarding individuals in the top decile for number of needs, 33 (11.0%) breast, 13 (10.8%) colorectal and 4 (10.0%) testicular were found to have at least 8, 5, and 7 unmet needs, respectively. High‐needs breast cancer participants (≥8), compared with the rest (<8), were significantly younger (mean [SD] 55.21 [9.20] vs. 61.07 [11.32] years, unpaired  t  test  p  = 0.002) and (marginally) more likely to have received chemotherapy ( n  = 15, 45.5% vs.  n  = 79, 29.7%, chi‐square test:  p  = 0.066). Colorectal participants were also more likely to report high unmet needs (≥5 vs. <5) if they had received chemotherapy ( n  = 6, 46.2% vs.  n  = 28, 26.2%, chi‐square test:  p  = 0.031) and were more highly educated (Mann–Whitney  U  test  p  = 0.020). No other background characteristics were significantly associated with high unmet needs for any tumour site. Of the 52 breast cancer participants with the highest number of unmet needs at T0, 29 completed CaSUN at T2 of whom 16 (55.2%) remained in the top decile at T2. Similarly, 4/10 (40%) of colorectal and 2/4 (50%) testicular participants were in the highest decile at both T0 and T2. For breast participants, there were statistically significant decreases in unmet needs in every domain between T0 and T2, except Comprehensive Cancer Care; Information ( p  = 0.029), Existential Survivorship ( p  = 0.014), Relationships ( p  = 0.013) and Coping ( p  = 0.014). There were no statistically significant changes in any domain for colorectal and testicular participants (Table  3 ). No statistically significant difference in changes (T0 to T2) were found for any domain in comparisons between tumour sites. Item changes (T0 to T2) are shown in Table  3 . Most participants reported no unmet needs at T0 and T2 (far right column). There is evidence that individuals' unmet needs change over time. For example, 38 breast cancer survivors reported fear of cancer was resolved at T2, whilst it had become a new issue for 22 others. However, changes in the relative importance of different needs between T0 and T2, as shown by the rankings, are mostly marginal. A need for doctors to talk more to each other and for emotional support moved up the breast cancer rankings to within the top five issues at T2. Similarly, for colorectal participants, health service availability, best medical care and shared decision making with the clinical team acquired increased importance at T2. Numbers in the testicular group were small but amongst those, help with sex life emerged as an unmet need."

        "section_name": "DISCUSSION",
        "content": "Understanding the nature and extent of unmet needs of cancer survivors, and how these change over time, and differ between tumour groups, is important to inform service planning and optimise care delivery. Consistent with findings of other studies (Armes et al.,  2009 ; Boyes et al.,  2012 ; Bredart et al.,  2016 ; Valery et al.,  2017 ; Willems et al.,  2015 ), respondents reported low levels of unmet needs at both time points. Overall, levels of unmet need were lowest amongst colorectal survivors and diminished in all three groups over time (significantly for breast survivors). Others have also reported higher needs experienced by breast than colorectal survivors (Wylie et al.,  2013 ) and falling levels of need by breast survivors (Minstrell et al.,  2008 ; Von Heyman‐Horan et al.,  2013 ). Within these overall trends, there is evidence that for some individuals needs resolve and that new needs can emerge. Routine and regular monitoring of unmet needs using appropriate tools is therefore necessary so that cancer care specialists and other health professionals can deliver personalised care based on individual needs, preferences and circumstances. Fear of cancer returning was reported as the paramount unmet need throughout and has been reported as the most common unmet need in many other studies, including in breast, colorectal and mixed cancer populations (Amatya et al.,  2014 ; Armes et al.,  2009 ; Boyes et al.,  2012 ; Simard et al.,  2013 ; Valery et al.,  2017 ). Testicular cancer survival rates are high (Cancer Research UK,  2017 ), but many men report persistent worries about recurrence (Bender et al.,  2012 ; Smith et al.,  2013 ,  2018 ). Receiving a diagnosis of a life‐threatening disease at a relatively young age can cause long‐term psychological distress (Schepisi et al.,  2019 ). Concern about care delivery was indicated by colorectal survivors, especially at T2. This finding aligns with other studies (Russell et al.,  2015 ) but may reflect local services and not be generalisable. Research in other locations has noted more unmet needs associated with care delivery amongst breast than colorectal survivors (Wylie et al.,  2013 ). The need to reduce stress in life was the second most frequently cited need in all three tumour groups at T2. It was also in the top five unmet needs for breast and testicular survivors at T0 (11th for colorectal). Stress is also frequently cited as an unmet need in other studies (Brennan et al.,  2016 ; Burris et al.,  2015 ; Geller et al.,  2014 ). Feelings of stress in life might arise from factors unrelated to cancer, but issues in early survivorship may provoke and exacerbate stress. In the transition from patient to survivor post‐treatment, interactions with health care teams who have provided support diminish and assistance from friends and family may also fade as pressure mounts for the survivors to resume “normal” lives (Van Liew et al.,  2014 ). There is little comparative data available on testicular survivors (White et al.,  2012 ; Willems et al.,  2015 ), but existing evidence supports the findings of this study that existential issues, such as fear of recurrence and body image, are important (Bender et al.,  2012 ; Smith et al.,  2013 ). Problems with sexual functioning post‐treatment was an emergent issue at T2 amongst testicular survivors, and a consistent source of concern to breast and colorectal survivors. This can be linked to body image changes, loss of confidence and problems restoring intimate relationships (Matheson et al.,  2016 ). A challenge for health services is to balance resource constraints with meeting the care needs of the rising cancer survivor population. Stratified clinical pathways as implemented within the British NHS (NHS Improvement,  2013 ) seek to target formal support on individuals with the highest needs, offering continuing outpatient appointments to selected survivors with health issues that are considered to warrant ongoing clinical follow‐up. For other survivors, emotional and coping needs are addressed through supported self‐management programmes which provide generic information and advice on keeping well and self‐monitoring for signs of recurrence. In this study, survivors with the highest number of unmet needs at T0 (and T2) reported at least 10 (and 8) breast, 7 (and 5) colorectal and 7 (and 7) testicular, suggesting significant negative impact on quality of life. About one half of people with the highest number of needs at T0 were also reporting the highest number of persistent needs at T2, the others at T2 reporting emerging needs. Other mixed cancer studies confirm that needs persist for many of the highest need survivors (Armes et al.,  2009 ; Valery et al.,  2017 ). These findings indicate that some survivors experience significant problems in the early months after treatment which can persist thereafter that warrant formal assessment and monitoring. This may also affect individuals discharged for self‐care, as well as those receiving routine clinic follow up (Jefford et al.,  2013 ). In terms of targeting the survivors at risk of having high numbers of unmet needs, the findings of this study suggest that having had chemotherapy was significant amongst breast and colorectal survivors. Younger age was also important for the breast group. Higher education was associated with more unmet needs for colorectal survivors at T2 and marginally for breast survivors at T0. As an indicator of more challenging disease, chemotherapy may give rise to higher anxiety levels and result in a higher symptom burden extending into the post‐treatment phase. No characteristics were associated with higher numbers of unmet needs amongst testicular survivors; however, the sample was small. Unlike chemotherapy, adjuvant hormone therapy was not associated with more unmet needs amongst breast survivors even though this is both a reminder of the diagnosis and a cause of side effects (Brennan et al.,  2016 ). Stress and coping issues are common in cancer survivors and can significantly affect wellbeing (Geller et al.,  2014 ). Little is known about the value of routine clinic follow‐up for meeting psycho‐social needs, and views may vary between individuals. Contact with health professionals may provide reassurance to some that is foregone in self‐management programmes. Alternatively, anticipation of hospital appointments may be an unwanted reminder of cancer for others. A recent study of men in the first 8 months after treatment for prostate cancer concluded that supported self‐management was at least comparable (on various patient reported measures and unmet needs) to appointment‐based follow‐up and cost neutral (Frankland et al.,  2019 ). Further in‐depth analysis of expectations and experiences is, however, warranted, with tracking of recurrence, survival and adverse outcomes, as well as whole system costs, over a longer period (Frankland et al.,  2019 ). Fear of recurrence was found to be the most common unmet need and one that endures for all tumour groups. It is deemed “normal” amongst adults with a cancer history, and a degree of concern is considered functional to prompt self‐protective responses and staying alert to signs of recurrence (Lebel et al.,  2014 ). High or moderate levels of anxiety, however, can negatively affect quality of life and requires appropriate supportive care (Sarkar et al.,  2015 ). Routine clinic contact enables anxieties to be identified and addressed. Health care teams can encourage disclosure, provide information and respond to psychosocial aspects of fear, including referral to local specialist resources if required. Some groups have been shown to benefit from provision of a survivor care plan and a written summary for self‐management (Brennan et al.,  2014 ; Howell et al.,  2017 ; Jefford et al.,  2017 ). Mind–body interventions (such as cognitive‐behavioural and mindfulness) have also been found efficacious (Hall et al.,  2018 ) and targeted on line self‐management interventions such as ConquerFear (Butow et al.,  2017 ; Smith et al.,  2017 ), and Mini‐AFTERc (Davidson et al.,  2018 ) can be integrated into specialist nurse clinical practice. Follow‐up has also been reported beneficial for providing sexual function information and discussing relationship issues (Averyt & Nishimoto,  2014 ; Brand et al.,  2015 ) identified as significant needs for some survivors in this study, with implications for wellbeing and quality of life. Contrary to other evidence reporting declining need for emotional support over time amongst breast cancer survivors (Burris et al.,  2015 ), this study identified existential survivorship was a continuing issue. Social support from family and friends is beneficial to the psychological wellbeing of survivors (Smith et al.,  2018 ), and decreasing levels of social support after treatment have been linked to reduced quality of life (Grimmett et al.,  2017 ). Assessment of gaps in support through follow‐up, when survivors are searching for meaning in their life, is relevant for all cancer survivors to instigate signposting to support groups, or health and well‐being programmes, or referral to targeted professional input (Fenlon et al.,  2015 ; Grimmett et al.,  2017 ). Table  3  provides extensive information on observed change rates in 25 different unmet needs for all three tumour groups, enabling required sample sizes to be formulated for future studies seeking to evaluate targeted interventions for specific needs."

Mind–body interventions (such as cognitive‐behavioural and mindfulness) have also been found efficacious (Hall et al.,  2018 ) and targeted on line self‐management interventions such as ConquerFear (Butow et al.,  2017 ; Smith et al.,  2017 ), and Mini‐AFTERc (Davidson et al.,  2018 ) can be integrated into specialist nurse clinical practice. Follow‐up has also been reported beneficial for providing sexual function information and discussing relationship issues (Averyt & Nishimoto,  2014 ; Brand et al.,  2015 ) identified as significant needs for some survivors in this study, with implications for wellbeing and quality of life. Contrary to other evidence reporting declining need for emotional support over time amongst breast cancer survivors (Burris et al.,  2015 ), this study identified existential survivorship was a continuing issue. Social support from family and friends is beneficial to the psychological wellbeing of survivors (Smith et al.,  2018 ), and decreasing levels of social support after treatment have been linked to reduced quality of life (Grimmett et al.,  2017 ). Assessment of gaps in support through follow‐up, when survivors are searching for meaning in their life, is relevant for all cancer survivors to instigate signposting to support groups, or health and well‐being programmes, or referral to targeted professional input (Fenlon et al.,  2015 ; Grimmett et al.,  2017 ). Table  3  provides extensive information on observed change rates in 25 different unmet needs for all three tumour groups, enabling required sample sizes to be formulated for future studies seeking to evaluate targeted interventions for specific needs."

        "content": "There are several limitations to this study. The CaSUN survey instrument was modified following patient feedback, but the changes were minor and did not affect the scoring which followed recommended guidelines. Indeed, demonstrates that the five domains behaved similarly across the three tumour sites confirming that the modified tool performed consistently. The testicular sample was small and the study ran out of time and resources such that some participants were not included in the follow‐up data collection thereby reducing the size of the sample in all three tumour groups at T2. Moreover, follow‐up was limited to 8 months whilst survivorship is lifelong. Questionnaire responses included information on needs that were met (80% of all reported needs), and these have not been reported. Unmet needs of all strengths were combined in the analysis without any weighting. The study was conducted in one health trust in England, and findings may not be generalisable. The study combined patients treated over a period in which follow‐up protocols were changing and by the end of the study 24% of participants were in self‐management follow up regimens. Comparison of the two groups, however, found no difference at T0 nor in the subsequent change in number of unmet needs from T0 at T2."

        "section_name": "CONCLUSIONS",
        "content": "This study contributes to the knowledge regarding unmet supportive care needs of breast, colorectal and testicular cancer survivors early after the end of treatment and two thirds of the way through their first year. The results indicate that most survivors had few or no unmet needs at the end of treatment or 8 months later but a small proportion had significant numbers of persisting or emerging needs. Further research is required to explore the long term clinical, psychosocial and economic implications of supported self‐management programmes, compared to clinic follow‐up for different groups of cancer survivors. Individual survivors have varying levels and types of needs and personalised approaches to care are required. A recent analysis found that individuals' background and presence of symptoms play a more important role in the profile of unmet needs than cancer type (Watanabe et al.,  2020 ). Our study findings differ from those of others in some respects but inconsistencies in evidence about unmet needs have been widely reported (Puts et al.,  2012 ; Willems et al.,  2015 ). The reasons for this also require investigation, including the extent to which the differences reflect local factors and settings."

    "title": "Understanding the health-related quality of life and treatment-related side-effects in patients who have been in remission from testicular cancer for 12–24 months",
    "abstract": "Introduction Despite the excellent long-term prognosis after treatment for testicular cancer (TCa), therapy-related side effects can be persistent and severe. The aim of this study was to determine the nature and prevalence of post-treatment symptoms and their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in TCa patients 12 to 24 months after treatment. Materials and methods Cross-sectional, single-center study. All patients who were aged 18 and over, had completed TCa treatment 12–24 months previously and had no evidence of disease recurrence were considered eligible. Participants were stratified into four groups: 1) orchidectomy only; 2) orchidectomy and single dose adjuvant carboplatin; 3) multi-agent induction chemotherapy (CBOP-BEP, BEPx3 or x4, or Epx4 regimens); and 4) post-chemo retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND). Eligible patients were asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and the EORTC QLQ-TC26 questionnaire. We performed a thematic analysis of free-text commentary to evaluate the sensitivity of PROMs used across the treatment groups. Descriptive results were reported. For categorical variables, numbers and percentages were used, and for continuous variables median and IQR values were used. Results The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire showed that patients treated with orchidectomy only and orchidectomy and adjuvant carboplatin experienced only minor physical medium- to long-term side-effects. In contrast, more intensive treatment regimens, such as multi-agent chemotherapy or PC-RPLND, were associated with a higher burden of medium- to long-term side-effects. Similar results were obtained with the EORTC QLQ-TC26 questionnaire. Conclusions This study reports the medium- to long-term HRQoL and side effects of TCa treatments, using both EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QLQ-TC26 questionnaires, and identifies possibly “unasked” questions from a patient perspective in relation to supportive care needs following TCa treatment. This information will help clinicians to better understand the consequences of treatment and in turn provide better patient counseling before treatment.",

        "content": "Testicular cancer (TCa) is the most common solid organ malignancy affecting young men, and represents 5% of all urological cancers ( 1 ,  2 ). Its treatment typically involves a plethora of treatments ( 3 ) depending on stage and histologic sub-type. The specific consideration of patient experiences may be less of a priority due to an incomplete understanding of what these experiences precisely are. Patients may have difficulty articulating their experiences in treatment discussions and feel an obligation to concur with clinician advice when more than one option exists ( 4 – 7 ). In this study we observe and compare the prevalence of post-treatment symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 12–24 months following treatment in patients treated in a UK tertiary TCa center. We also performed a thematic analysis of free-text commentary to evaluate the sensitivity of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used across the treatment groups."

        "content": "The study had a mixed-methods cross-sectional design, incorporating the collection of quantitative data from PROMs and qualitative data from free-text responses (the two questions asked of patients). The sample comprised 73 TCa patients, who were identified and recruited through a review of weekly TCa multi-disciplinary team meetings (MDTs) and Royal Marsden testicular cancer clinics. All patients (aged 18 and over) who had completed one of the following treatments for TCa and had no evidence of disease recurrence were considered eligible: 1) orchidectomy only, henceforth the orchidectomy only group; 2) orchidectomy and single-dose adjuvant carboplatin, henceforth the orchidectomy and carboplatin group; 3) multi-agent induction chemotherapy (CBOP-BEP, BEPx3 or x4, or EPx4 regimens), henceforth the multi-agent chemotherapy group; and 4) post-chemo retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND), henceforth the PC-RPLND group. Patients were excluded from the study if they had undergone high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant, were unable to read and write in English, or were regarded as lacking the capacity to provide informed consent. To evaluate the medium- to long-term side effects of treatment, all patients included in the study had completed TCa treatment 12 to 24 months before the study. A questionnaire was developed to include two PROMs designed to measure HRQoL: the EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QLQ-TC26. The EQ-5D-5L is a widely used generic instrument for assessing HRQoL ( 8 ,  9 ). It comprises two parts, with the first part being a “descriptive system” in which respondents are asked to grade five descriptors (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) based on the severity of problems. The second part is a visual analog scale, in which respondents are asked to rate their health on that day on a scale from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable) ( 10 ). The EORTC QLQ-TC26 questionnaire is a validated measure which has previously been used to study post-treatment side effect severity and prevalence in TCa patients, particularly in the chemotherapy setting. The QLQ-TC26 employs a symptom severity score (0 = not at all, 1 = a little, 2 = quite a bit, and 3 = very much) and comprises seven multi-item scales (treatment side effects, treatment satisfaction, future perspective, communication, sexual activity, functioning, and enjoyment) and six single items (job and education problems, physical limitations, family problems, infertility, body image problems, and testicular transplant satisfaction). Patients responding to the survey were also invited to describe any symptoms/problems that are not addressed/recognized as sequelae of treatment in the PROMs questionnaires. They were also asked to describe the aspect of TCa that had had the greatest impact on their lives, with the aim of providing an in-depth understanding of the supportive care needs of patients that was framed by their own perspectives and priorities. Those who opted to complete the free-text component were provided with two questions: (1) “Are there any symptoms or problems caused by testicular cancer treatment that affect you now that have not been mentioned or well described in this form?”, and (2) “Which single aspect of testicular cancer treatment has had the greatest impact on your quality of life and why?” ( 11 ). Inductive thematic analysis of the questionnaire free-text answers was undertaken whereby all datasets were read and re-read by a single researcher (NK) so that emerging themes (“funneling”) ( 12 ) could be identified. These key themes were extracted and described using a narrative analysis technique (31). These themes were then reviewed by a second researcher (WC). Statistical tests were conducted using R statistical software (version 3.4.3). Regulatory and ethics committee approval was granted by The Royal Marsden NHS Trust’s Research and Development Committee (Ref. No CCR4937). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013)."

        "content": "Analysis of the “descriptive system” portion of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire showed that patients in the orchidectomy only and orchidectomy and carboplatin groups experienced few physical medium- to long-term side effects. Only a small proportion of patients within the orchidectomy only group reported a “slight” (1 out of 19 patients; 5.3%) or “moderate” (1 out of 19 patients; 5.3%) degree of impairment when carrying out their usual activities. Four patients (21.1%) in the orchidectomy only group reported a “slight” to “moderate” degree of pain/discomfort after treatment. This was also observed within the orchidectomy and carboplatin group (3 out of 13 patients; 23.1%), with one patient (7.7%) reporting severe pain/discomfort ( Supplementary Table 1 ;  Figure 1 ). Bar plot reporting the results from the ED-5D-5L questionnaire. Levels: 1 = no problem, 2 = slight problem, 3 = moderate problem, 4 = severe problem, and 5 = extreme problem. In contrast, more intensive treatment regimens, such as multi-agent chemotherapy or PC-RPLND, were associated with a greater burden of medium- to long-term side effects. In particular, 4 out of 22 PC-RPLND patients (18.2%) reported “slight” to “moderate” mobility impairment (Q8), 2 out of 22 patients (9%) reported problems in the self-care domain (Q9), and 7 out of 22 patients (31.8%) reported problems when carrying out their usual activities (Q10). Multi-agent chemotherapy alone had less impact on the mobility (1 out of 19 patients; 5.3%) and self-care domains (0 out of 19 patients; 0%), and seven out of 19 patients (36.9%) in this group reported a “slight” to “moderate” degree of impairment when carrying out their usual activities. Both treatments were associated with significant rates of medium- to long-term pain/discomfort; these symptoms were reported by 8 out of 19 patients (42.1%) in the multi-agent chemotherapy group, and 8 out of 22 patients (36.4%) in the PC-RPLND group ( Supplementary Table 1 ;  Figure 1 ). With respect to the emotional burden of treatment, anxiety domain results were comparable across all treatment groups, with the exception of the orchidectomy and carboplatin group. Over half of patients treated with orchiectomy only (13 out of 19 patients; 57.9%) reported anxiety/depression; this was similar to results for the multi-agent chemotherapy group (8 out of 19 patients; 44.5%) and the PC-RPLND group (13 out of 22 patients; 59%). In the orchidectomy and carboplatin group, the rate of reported anxiety was much lower (4 out of 13 patients; 30.8%), with the majority reporting being only “slightly” anxious ( Supplementary Table 1 ;  Figure 1 ). Findings from analysis of the VAS data were consistent those found from the “descriptive system”, in the sense that men in the orchidectomy only and orchidectomy and carboplatin groups reported a higher self-perceived health status score than those undergoing more intensive treatment regimes ( Supplementary Table 2 ;  Figure 2 ). VAS obtained by ED-5D-5L questionnaire for the different treatment groups. VAS, visual analog scale. With EORTC-QLQ TC26, both the multi-agent chemotherapy and PC-RPLND groups had a similar side-effect profile. Specifically, both treatments induced a degree of perceived muscle loss and reduced strength, with these being reported by 13 out of 19 patients (68.4%) and 17 out of 22 patients (77.3%) in the multi-agent chemotherapy and PC-RPLND groups, respectively. The most commonly reported side effects in the multi-agent chemotherapy group were “tingling or numbness in extremities” (13 out of 19 patients; 68.4%), “Raynaud’s phenomenon” (10 out of 19 patients; 52.6%)”, “tinnitus” (7 out of 19 patients; 38.9%), “shortness of breath” (9 out of 19 patients; 47.4%), and “problems with taste and smell” (6 out of 19 patients; 31.6%). Over half of the surgically managed patients in the PC-RPLND group reported “problems with ejaculation” (14/22; 63.6%) and “concerns with body image” (12/22; 54,6%) ( Supplementary Table 3 ). The orchidectomy only and the orchidectomy and carboplatin groups shared a similar side-effects profile with the exception of questions Q17.1 and Q17.2, which addressed the psychological impact of the treatment. In the orchidectomy and carboplatin group, 8 out of 13 (61.5%) patients reported not feeling uncertain about the future, compared with 6 out of 19 patients (42.9%) in the orchidectomy only group ( Supplementary Table 3 ). The free-text responses to question 1 (“Are there any symptoms or problems caused by testicular cancer treatment that affect you now that have not been mentioned or well described in this form?”) revealed a range of recurring recollections, feelings, and opinions, described below according to the following themes: (1) shortness of breath (SOB), (2) pain, (3) body image, (4) cognitive impairment, and (5) anxiety.  Supplementary Table 4  summarizes the key findings from the responses. One-third of patients who offered free-text commentary felt that although the EORTC QLQ-TC26 asked about severity of SOB [(1) not at all, (2) a little, (3) quite a bit, and (4) very much], this did not adequately reflect either the breadth or context of the problem. Patients described their SOB in a variety of ways: “feeling breathless while resting”, having “weak lungs”, “finding it so hard to breathe”, or being “chesty in the mornings”. The most common theme described by participants as being poorly defined by the PROMs questions was “pain”. Descriptions of pain ranged from “discomfort in wound site from orchiectomy” to a “slight pain/discomfort when ejaculating” to “pain daily at night”, suggesting that the patients who had commented (i.e., 50% of respondents) were unhappy with the binary format of the severity scoring system associated with the EORTC QLQ-TC26. Body image was mentioned by one-quarter of respondents. The comments on this issue included “I am a bit self-conscious about the prosthesis”, “I was left with permanent pigmentation on my body after chemotherapy”, “my toe and finger nails are damaged”, and “I suffered from incomplete regrowth of hair”. Once again, this suggests that body image is an issue that is too complex to be adequately articulated using a binary assessment score. Cognitive impairment was reported by respondents who had received chemotherapy (i.e., those in the multi-agent chemotherapy, RPLND, and orchidectomy and carboplatin groups). Participant responses included “It was 1 year after chemo before I felt ‘normal’ and back to my old self”, “I suffered from mild cognitive impairment for almost a year”, “Memory recall was challenging for example I could not remember people’s names”, and “My concentration and speed of thought is not good”. This theme, which was the most common across respondents (reported by 80% of respondents), had two discrete subthemes: (a) anxiety associated with cancer recurrence and (b) heightened anxiety associated with formal follow-up. a. Anxiety associated with cancer recurrence Many men described the daily psychological impact associated with the fear of cancer recurrence as being debilitating. One commented: “I have a 2-year-old and another baby due in January 2019 (conceived 18 months after treatment—yey)! and I worry about long term life expectancy”. Another reported having “the lingering thought that it may return”, with another suggesting that “not knowing the true cause and the likelihood of it returning is stressful”. b. Heightened anxiety associated with formal follow-up Anxiety around the time of cancer follow-up appointments was also described by many as preventing them from moving on. Comments included “when I go to the cancer center for check-ups I see people suffering infinitely worse than I did. So I almost feel like I do not have the right to talk about it or to acknowledge it happened to me, but it did!”, and “the fact you had it once always makes you anxious but especially during check-up time. So it’s more of a mental impact than physical”. Responses to the second free-text question (“Which single aspect of testicular cancer treatment has had the greatest impact on your quality of life and why?”) are described across the following themes: body image and fatigue ( Supplementary Table 5 ). Participants described the emotional impact of cancer as presenting itself in a myriad of ways. One man suggested “I suffer from claustrophobia now”, and another commented that “whilst I’m not a worrier and have a healthy attitude to getting on with it in life, I do wonder how if at all, how the chemotherapy has affected me”. Another suggested that their ongoing anxiety arose from the fear of cancer recurrence: “I had my left testicle removed and around the groin of my right one, it feels knotty I think this might be my lymph glands. It has been checked out but still causes me anxiety”. Across all treatment groups, men described body image issues as having a significant impact on a daily basis. One patient said that “since the chemo I cannot be clean shaven or have short hair, as I cannot look at myself in a mirror, it reminds me of being ill”. Others suggested that treatment had changed their body habitus: “I seem to have developed fatty chest tissue which I am very self-conscious about”, and “I am self-conscious about the look of the prosthesis”. Men in the PC-RPLND and orchidectomy and carboplatin groups described “a lack of energy and poor general fitness that lingered”. They described it as “hard to get back into exercise”, with one saying “only now almost 2 years after diagnosis have I managed to start doing proper regular exercise”. In the other groups, patients commented on “a lack of energy resulting in inactivity and weight gain”."

The most commonly reported side effects in the multi-agent chemotherapy group were “tingling or numbness in extremities” (13 out of 19 patients; 68.4%), “Raynaud’s phenomenon” (10 out of 19 patients; 52.6%)”, “tinnitus” (7 out of 19 patients; 38.9%), “shortness of breath” (9 out of 19 patients; 47.4%), and “problems with taste and smell” (6 out of 19 patients; 31.6%). Over half of the surgically managed patients in the PC-RPLND group reported “problems with ejaculation” (14/22; 63.6%) and “concerns with body image” (12/22; 54,6%) ( Supplementary Table 3 ). The orchidectomy only and the orchidectomy and carboplatin groups shared a similar side-effects profile with the exception of questions Q17.1 and Q17.2, which addressed the psychological impact of the treatment. In the orchidectomy and carboplatin group, 8 out of 13 (61.5%) patients reported not feeling uncertain about the future, compared with 6 out of 19 patients (42.9%) in the orchidectomy only group ( Supplementary Table 3 )."

        "content": "Analysis of the “descriptive system” portion of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire showed that patients in the orchidectomy only and orchidectomy and carboplatin groups experienced few physical medium- to long-term side effects. Only a small proportion of patients within the orchidectomy only group reported a “slight” (1 out of 19 patients; 5.3%) or “moderate” (1 out of 19 patients; 5.3%) degree of impairment when carrying out their usual activities. Four patients (21.1%) in the orchidectomy only group reported a “slight” to “moderate” degree of pain/discomfort after treatment. This was also observed within the orchidectomy and carboplatin group (3 out of 13 patients; 23.1%), with one patient (7.7%) reporting severe pain/discomfort ( Supplementary Table 1 ;  Figure 1 ). Bar plot reporting the results from the ED-5D-5L questionnaire. Levels: 1 = no problem, 2 = slight problem, 3 = moderate problem, 4 = severe problem, and 5 = extreme problem. In contrast, more intensive treatment regimens, such as multi-agent chemotherapy or PC-RPLND, were associated with a greater burden of medium- to long-term side effects. In particular, 4 out of 22 PC-RPLND patients (18.2%) reported “slight” to “moderate” mobility impairment (Q8), 2 out of 22 patients (9%) reported problems in the self-care domain (Q9), and 7 out of 22 patients (31.8%) reported problems when carrying out their usual activities (Q10). Multi-agent chemotherapy alone had less impact on the mobility (1 out of 19 patients; 5.3%) and self-care domains (0 out of 19 patients; 0%), and seven out of 19 patients (36.9%) in this group reported a “slight” to “moderate” degree of impairment when carrying out their usual activities. Both treatments were associated with significant rates of medium- to long-term pain/discomfort; these symptoms were reported by 8 out of 19 patients (42.1%) in the multi-agent chemotherapy group, and 8 out of 22 patients (36.4%) in the PC-RPLND group ( Supplementary Table 1 ;  Figure 1 ). With respect to the emotional burden of treatment, anxiety domain results were comparable across all treatment groups, with the exception of the orchidectomy and carboplatin group. Over half of patients treated with orchiectomy only (13 out of 19 patients; 57.9%) reported anxiety/depression; this was similar to results for the multi-agent chemotherapy group (8 out of 19 patients; 44.5%) and the PC-RPLND group (13 out of 22 patients; 59%). In the orchidectomy and carboplatin group, the rate of reported anxiety was much lower (4 out of 13 patients; 30.8%), with the majority reporting being only “slightly” anxious ( Supplementary Table 1 ;  Figure 1 ). Findings from analysis of the VAS data were consistent those found from the “descriptive system”, in the sense that men in the orchidectomy only and orchidectomy and carboplatin groups reported a higher self-perceived health status score than those undergoing more intensive treatment regimes ( Supplementary Table 2 ;  Figure 2 ).

        "content": "The free-text responses to question 1 (“Are there any symptoms or problems caused by testicular cancer treatment that affect you now that have not been mentioned or well described in this form?”) revealed a range of recurring recollections, feelings, and opinions, described below according to the following themes: (1) shortness of breath (SOB), (2) pain, (3) body image, (4) cognitive impairment, and (5) anxiety.  Supplementary Table 4  summarizes the key findings from the responses. One-third of patients who offered free-text commentary felt that although the EORTC QLQ-TC26 asked about severity of SOB [(1) not at all, (2) a little, (3) quite a bit, and (4) very much], this did not adequately reflect either the breadth or context of the problem. Patients described their SOB in a variety of ways: “feeling breathless while resting”, having “weak lungs”, “finding it so hard to breathe”, or being “chesty in the mornings”. The most common theme described by participants as being poorly defined by the PROMs questions was “pain”. Descriptions of pain ranged from “discomfort in wound site from orchiectomy” to a “slight pain/discomfort when ejaculating” to “pain daily at night”, suggesting that the patients who had commented (i.e., 50% of respondents) were unhappy with the binary format of the severity scoring system associated with the EORTC QLQ-TC26. Body image was mentioned by one-quarter of respondents. The comments on this issue included “I am a bit self-conscious about the prosthesis”, “I was left with permanent pigmentation on my body after chemotherapy”, “my toe and finger nails are damaged”, and “I suffered from incomplete regrowth of hair”. Once again, this suggests that body image is an issue that is too complex to be adequately articulated using a binary assessment score. Cognitive impairment was reported by respondents who had received chemotherapy (i.e., those in the multi-agent chemotherapy, RPLND, and orchidectomy and carboplatin groups). Participant responses included “It was 1 year after chemo before I felt ‘normal’ and back to my old self”, “I suffered from mild cognitive impairment for almost a year”, “Memory recall was challenging for example I could not remember people’s names”, and “My concentration and speed of thought is not good”. This theme, which was the most common across respondents (reported by 80% of respondents), had two discrete subthemes: (a) anxiety associated with cancer recurrence and (b) heightened anxiety associated with formal follow-up. a. Anxiety associated with cancer recurrence Many men described the daily psychological impact associated with the fear of cancer recurrence as being debilitating. One commented: “I have a 2-year-old and another baby due in January 2019 (conceived 18 months after treatment—yey)! and I worry about long term life expectancy”. Another reported having “the lingering thought that it may return”, with another suggesting that “not knowing the true cause and the likelihood of it returning is stressful”. b. Heightened anxiety associated with formal follow-up Anxiety around the time of cancer follow-up appointments was also described by many as preventing them from moving on. Comments included “when I go to the cancer center for check-ups I see people suffering infinitely worse than I did. So I almost feel like I do not have the right to talk about it or to acknowledge it happened to me, but it did!”, and “the fact you had it once always makes you anxious but especially during check-up time. So it’s more of a mental impact than physical”. Responses to the second free-text question (“Which single aspect of testicular cancer treatment has had the greatest impact on your quality of life and why?”) are described across the following themes: body image and fatigue ( Supplementary Table 5 ). Participants described the emotional impact of cancer as presenting itself in a myriad of ways. One man suggested “I suffer from claustrophobia now”, and another commented that “whilst I’m not a worrier and have a healthy attitude to getting on with it in life, I do wonder how if at all, how the chemotherapy has affected me”. Another suggested that their ongoing anxiety arose from the fear of cancer recurrence: “I had my left testicle removed and around the groin of my right one, it feels knotty I think this might be my lymph glands. It has been checked out but still causes me anxiety”. Across all treatment groups, men described body image issues as having a significant impact on a daily basis. One patient said that “since the chemo I cannot be clean shaven or have short hair, as I cannot look at myself in a mirror, it reminds me of being ill”. Others suggested that treatment had changed their body habitus: “I seem to have developed fatty chest tissue which I am very self-conscious about”, and “I am self-conscious about the look of the prosthesis”. Men in the PC-RPLND and orchidectomy and carboplatin groups described “a lack of energy and poor general fitness that lingered”. They described it as “hard to get back into exercise”, with one saying “only now almost 2 years after diagnosis have I managed to start doing proper regular exercise”. In the other groups, patients commented on “a lack of energy resulting in inactivity and weight gain”."

        "content": "In this study, analysis of the highly structured PROMs measures (ED-5D-5L and EORTC QLQ-TC26) combined with the free-text commentary provided insights into possibly “unasked” or poorly defined quality-of-life issues (according to patients) and into the single aspect of TCa that has the greatest impact on their lives. The multimodal nature of TCa treatment exposes patients to a plethora of possible side effects that might significantly impact their quality of life at a very young age. Studies reporting on the most frequently occurring side effects identify them by treatment modality; multi-agent chemotherapy treatments most commonly cause hearing loss, tinnitus, peripheral neuropathy, Raynaud-like phenomena, and infertility ( 13 ), with the status at 1 year post-treatment likely to reflect long-term morbidity ( 4 ). Impaired ejaculation frequently occurs following RPLND ( 14 ), and radiation treatment may cause long-term intestinal problems, radiation-induced secondary malignant neoplasms, and muscle twitching ( 15 ,  16 ). In addition, fertility concerns, body image issues, and sexual dysfunction (including impaired ejaculation and decreased sexual satisfaction) are intrinsic themes of life after TCa treatment as the patient group affected are largely men within the fertile age range ( 17 ). As a result of these physical morbidities, this young cohort of cancer survivors also exhibits demonstrably higher rates of depressive symptoms (34%) and depression and anxiety disorders (19%  vs . 13.5%) compared with the general population ( 18 – 21 ). The results derived from the quantitative aspects of this study describe and confirm the prevalence of previously reported side effects. The use of both the ED-5D-5L and the EORTC QLQ-TC26 gives insight into the landscape of side effects following different treatment modalities. Our qualitative analysis develops our understanding by identifying potentially “unasked” questions from a patient perspective that could ultimately improve post-treatment supportive care. Our study included patients who received orchiectomy and a single dose adjuvant carboplatin. This treatment modality is an option for high-risk stage 1 seminomas (defined as being > 4 cm in maximum dimension and rete testis invasion (RTI)) to reduce this risk. Analysis of this group compared with other treatment groups suggested that patients had less anxiety related to possible cancer recurrence, with a very similar side-effect profile to those in the orchidectomy alone group. For some patients the provision of information that adjuvant treatment for stage 1 seminoma may offer a better quality of life, without impacting on their side-effect profile, may inform their decision as to which treatment to opt for. Although quantitative analysis of the survey’s closed questions indicated that that a substantial proportion of individuals report ongoing health needs ( 22 ), these data do not shed light on the experiences of treatment aftercare, or on what might improve health outcomes or patient experiences. Nevertheless, the fact that more than half (41 out of 73) of participants took the opportunity to comment  via  the free-text questions provides a significant resource in itself. Although this cannot be viewed as “representative” of all patients, these data provide rich insights into the views of patients regarding the PROMs that are currently in use in TCa follow-up and the questions (some of them unasked) that have patient-weighted importance. These data are not available in other surveys or interview studies of TCa survivors published to date ( 23 ). The methodology for this study, adopted alongside formal PROMs measures, demonstrates that individuals actively engage with the opportunity to provide comments related to their experiences, therefore providing data relating to which health outcomes should be reported in formal measures and illuminating the analysis of results from currently available questionnaires ( 24 ). Despite the informative nature of this mixed-methods study, it has limitations. A single-center and single-country/language design introduces a selection bias that might limit the generalizability of results. In addition, as a single-site study, and despite the addition of a free-text section, there may well be many more side effects and therefore supportive care requirements that are yet to be disclosed by patients facing a lifetime of living with and beyond the consequences of their cancer treatment."

These results may allow for improved patient counseling regarding side effects and QoL experienced following different treatment modalities. This can help to better inform patients, optimize the consenting process pre-treatment, and highlight patients’ potential post-treatment needs. Future research, particularly into the aforementioned “unasked” questions, may improve this further."

    "title": "Incidence of testicular cancer in trans women using gender‐affirming hormonal treatment: a nationwide cohort study",
    "abstract": "Objective To assess the incidence of testicular cancer in trans women (male sex assigned at birth, female gender identity) using gender‐affirming hormonal treatment. Patients and Methods Data of trans women starting hormonal treatment at our gender identity clinic between 1972 and 2017 were linked to the national pathology database to obtain testicular cancer diagnoses. The standardised incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated using the number of observed testicular cancer cases in our cohort and the number of expected cases based on age‐specific Dutch incidence rates. Subgroup analyses were performed in testicular tissues sent for histopathological analysis at the time of bilateral orchidectomy, and when follow‐up exceeded 5 years. Results The cohort consisted of 3026 trans women with a median follow‐up time of 2.3 interquartile range (IQR) (1.6–3.7) years. Two testicular cancer cases were identified whilst 2.4 cases were expected (SIR 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.1–2.8). In addition, one testicular cancer case was encountered in an orchidectomy specimen (0.1%). In the 523 trans women with a follow‐up time of >5 years (median [IQR] 8.9 [6.4–13.9] years), no testicular cancer was observed. Conclusion Testicular cancer risk in trans women is similar to the risk in cis men. The testicular cancer cases occurred within the first 5 years after commencing hormonal treatment, and the percentage of cases encountered at the time of bilateral orchidectomy was low. As no testicular cancer was observed in trans women with a long follow‐up period, long‐term hormonal treatment does not seem to increase testicular cancer risk.",

        "section_name": "Introduction",
        "content": "Testicular cancer mainly occurs in young people; the incidence in the Netherlands is 9.5 per 100 000 men, with a peak incidence of 32.4 per 100 000 men in those aged between 30 and 34 years [ 1 ]. Testicular cancers can roughly be divided into sex cord or gonadal stromal tumours and germ‐cell tumours, of which the latter most commonly occur. Germ‐cell tumours are further classified as seminoma, non‐seminoma, and mixed germ‐cell tumours. Prognosis, depending on histology, location of the primary tumour and metastases, and serum tumour marker levels, is generally better for seminoma compared to non‐seminoma [ 2 ]. Although the incidence has increased over the past 40 years in most countries, the aetiology of testicular cancer and the reasons for this rise remain unclear. Established risk factors for testicular cancer are a history of cryptorchidism, a low sperm count, presence of a contralateral testis tumour or a positive family history among first‐grade relatives for testicular cancer [ 2 ]. Some theories also suggest that a relative excess of exogenous oestrogens during pre‐ or post‐natal life (e.g. diethylstilbesterol, pesticides) may play a causal role in the development of testicular cancer [ 3 ,  4 ,  5 ]. It is hypothesised that, following endocrine disruption, some of the primordial germ cells lose track of their normal development and become premalignant cells that may develop into carcinoma  in situ  cells, which in their turn may develop into a complete cancer [ 4 ]. An increasing group of birth‐assigned males with long‐term exposure to exogenous oestrogens are people with gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria refers to the distress that results from a conflict between a person’s assigned sex at birth and one’s gender identity [ 6 ]. People assigned male at birth who also identify as male are referred to as cis men, whereas birth‐assigned males who identify as female are referred to as trans women. Birth‐assigned males who neither identify as male nor female fall under the umbrella term gender queer, non‐binary, or alternative gender. Birth‐assigned males with gender dysphoria desiring to align their physical characteristics with their gender identity can choose to undergo medical treatment, consisting of gender‐affirming hormonal treatment (GAHT) and gender‐affirming surgery (GAS). The hormonal treatment protocol usually consists of antiandrogens, to suppress serum testosterone concentrations, combined with oestrogens, to achieve feminisation. For people presenting during adolescence (aged <18 years) treatment can be initiated when a person reaches puberty (Tanner Stage ≥2) and aims to suppress pubertal development by administration of GnRH agonist (GnRHa). After at least 6 months of puberty suppression and having reached the age of 16 years, treatment can be supplemented with oestrogens. GAS can involve facial feminisation, breast augmentation, and bilateral orchidectomy often combined with vaginoplasty [ 7 ]. For the sake of clarity, we will refer to birth‐assigned males seeking feminising medical treatment as trans women. Until 2014, a sterilisation law was in place in the Netherlands, meaning that a gonadectomy was required for legal gender recognition. Therefore, almost all trans women visiting our gender identity clinic underwent this procedure until 2014. However, since this law has changed, an increasing number of people with non‐binary identities or less need to confirm to binary cis presentation choose to keep their male gonads. Consequently, in the future we might be faced with a growing population of young trans women using GAHT, who are still at risk for testicular cancer. Several studies have been conducted on the influence of androgen deprivation, oestradiol supplementation, or a combination of these two, on testicular tissue and showed incomplete spermatogenesis, a decreased diameter of seminiferous tubules, and increased peritubular hyalinisation [ 8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ]. However, very little is known about the influence on the occurrence of testicular cancer and only a few cases of testicular cancer in trans women using GAHT have been reported [ 12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ]. The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of testicular cancer in trans women using GAHT and, hereby, assess the safety of hormonal treatment in terms of testicular cancer risk. A secondary aim was to assess the outcome of histopathological analyses of orchidectomy specimens obtained during GAS."

        "content": "For this nationwide retrospective cohort study, we identified all people who visited the gender identity clinic of the Amsterdam UMC between 1972 and September 2017. Approximately 95% of all transgender people in the Netherlands visit our centre for either psychological, endocrine, or surgical treatment. As only trans women using GAHT were eligible for inclusion, people who never used GAHT, those who underwent bilateral orchidectomy prior to the start of GAHT, or those of whom the start date of GAHT was unknown, were excluded. Other exclusion criteria involved being aged <18 years at the time of the study (2020) or having used female and male hormones alternatingly during the follow‐up period. Lastly, as data were partially obtained from the Dutch national pathology database (PALGA), which covers histopathological diagnoses nationwide since 1991, trans women were also excluded when their last visit to the gender identity clinic was before 1991 [ 17 ]. Hormonal treatment for trans women generally consists of a combination of antiandrogens and oestrogens. The most commonly prescribed antiandrogen in this cohort was cyproterone acetate (10–100 mg daily) and only sporadically spironolactone (100–200 mg daily) was used. Different administration routes for oestrogens exist, such as transdermal, oral, and intramuscular formulations. The different types of oestrogens prescribed in our centre included oestradiol patches (50–150 µg/24 h twice weekly), oestradiol gel (0.75–3.0 mg daily), oestradiol valerate (2–6 mg daily), ethinyl oestradiol (25–100 µg daily), conjugated oestrogens (0.625–1.25 mg daily), oestradiol implants (20 mg every 3–6 months), and oestradiol injections (10–100 mg every 2–4 weeks). From 2001 onward, mainly oestradiol patches, oestradiol gel, or oestradiol valerate were used. People who started hormonal treatment when they were aged <18 years, often used GnRHa, namely triptorelin, prior to the start with oestrogens and continued this medication until orchidectomy. The Ethical Review Board of the VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, concluded that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (Wet medisch‐wetenschappelijk onderzoek met mensen [WMO]) did not apply to this study. Necessity for informed consent was waived because of the retrospective design, the large study population, and the risk of selection bias (e.g. excluding deceased trans women). Data on medical history (e.g. testicular cancer, cryptorchidism), age at start of GAHT, documented hormone use, endocrine laboratory results, date of bilateral orchidectomy, date of last visit to our clinic, and data on mortality were collected from the medical files of the participants. This database was linked to PALGA to obtain data regarding testicular cancer histology (germ‐cell tumours, sex cord/stromal tumours and germ cell neoplasia  in situ ) and the date of testicular cancer diagnosis [ 17 ]. Data on testicular cancer diagnosis were further validated by comparing notes from the medical files with data obtained from PALGA. Descriptive analyses were conducted to assess the characteristics of the cohort. Normally distributed data are presented as means with standard deviations (SDs) and non‐normally distributed data as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs). Mean oestradiol and testosterone concentrations were calculated by averaging the results from measurements performed during GAHT. In people who had started GAHT prior to their first visit to our clinic, we used the first known start date of GAHT to calculate the most accurate treatment duration. The follow‐up time was calculated as the number of years from the start of GAHT until, either the date of testicular cancer diagnosis, or the date of bilateral orchidectomy, or the date of death, or the date of the last visit to our gender identity clinic. To calculate the age‐adjusted standardised incidence ratio (SIR), we used the observed cases and the expected cases of testicular cancer in our cohort. Only testicular cancer cases that occurred after the start of GAHT were included for analysis. For our primary research aim, we only included testicular cancer cases that were discovered due to symptoms (e.g. scrotal mass or infertility), as cis men are similarly diagnosed. Expected cases were calculated based on age‐specific incidence rates obtained from the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation [ 1 ]. Since this organisation also uses data from PALGA to generate the incidence rates of testicular cancer in the Dutch population, this allows for a reliable comparison. For the sake of clarity, we will refer to the reference population as cis men, although we were not able to verify if this was true for the whole population. The SIR with 95% CI was calculated using a mid‐exact  P  test. As it remains largely unknown how GAHT during puberty affects testicular architecture in terms of testicular cancer risk, a subgroup analysis was performed for trans women who initiated GAHT when aged ≥18 years. Furthermore, in order to assess the effect of long‐term hormone use more accurately, a subgroup analysis was performed for trans women with a follow‐up time of ≥5 years. Lastly, to assess how often testicular cancer was discovered in orchidectomy specimens obtained during gender‐affirming surgery, a subgroup analysis was performed for trans women whose testicular tissue was sent for histopathological analysis at the time of bilateral orchidectomy.

Approximately 95% of all transgender people in the Netherlands visit our centre for either psychological, endocrine, or surgical treatment. As only trans women using GAHT were eligible for inclusion, people who never used GAHT, those who underwent bilateral orchidectomy prior to the start of GAHT, or those of whom the start date of GAHT was unknown, were excluded. Other exclusion criteria involved being aged <18 years at the time of the study (2020) or having used female and male hormones alternatingly during the follow‐up period. Lastly, as data were partially obtained from the Dutch national pathology database (PALGA), which covers histopathological diagnoses nationwide since 1991, trans women were also excluded when their last visit to the gender identity clinic was before 1991 [ 17 ]. Hormonal treatment for trans women generally consists of a combination of antiandrogens and oestrogens. The most commonly prescribed antiandrogen in this cohort was cyproterone acetate (10–100 mg daily) and only sporadically spironolactone (100–200 mg daily) was used. Different administration routes for oestrogens exist, such as transdermal, oral, and intramuscular formulations. The different types of oestrogens prescribed in our centre included oestradiol patches (50–150 µg/24 h twice weekly), oestradiol gel (0.75–3.0 mg daily), oestradiol valerate (2–6 mg daily), ethinyl oestradiol (25–100 µg daily), conjugated oestrogens (0.625–1.25 mg daily), oestradiol implants (20 mg every 3–6 months), and oestradiol injections (10–100 mg every 2–4 weeks).

        "content": "A total of 8015 people visited our gender identity clinic between 1972 and 2017 for either psychological, endocrine, or surgical treatment. After applying the in‐ and exclusion criteria, 3026 trans women were included in the study cohort (Fig.  1 ). The median (IQR) follow‐up time was 2.3 (1.6–3.7) years per person and the total follow‐up time of the entire cohort was 11 223 years (Fig.  2 ). The median (IQR) age at start of GAHT was 29 (22–41) years. At initiation of GAHT the median serum testosterone and oestradiol concentrations were in the normal male range. During GAHT serum oestradiol concentrations increased (median [IQR] 181 [110–296] pmol/L) and serum testosterone concentrations decreased (median [IQR] 1.0 [0.6–1.3] nmol/L). In this cohort, 1914 trans women (63%) underwent bilateral orchidectomy at a median (IQR) of 2.3 (1.7–3.4) years after commencing hormonal treatment. Last known hormone measurements before bilateral orchidectomy did not differ from the averaged results during GAHT (data not shown). Table  1  shows the characteristics of the entire study cohort. Study flow chart. Follow‐up time of the study cohort. Dashed line indicates cohort for subgroup analysis performed for trans women with a follow‐up time of ≥5 years. Characteristics of study cohort ( n  = 3026). In total, three cases of testicular cancer were observed in the study cohort. Age at the time of diagnosis of the three trans women with testicular cancer ranged from the second to the fourth decade of life. All three trans women were Caucasian, had no medical history of oncological diseases, and their family history was negative for testicular cancer. One person started treatment during adolescence, while the other two started GAHT in adulthood. Used antiandrogenic treatment involved tripterolin, cyproterone acetate, and spironolactone, resulting in serum testosterone levels of <2 nmol/L. Types of used oestrogens included oestradiol injections, oestradiol patches, and oestradiol valerate, resulting in mean serum oestradiol concentrations of between 150 and 300 pmol/L. Oestrogens were used for a duration of 1–3 years prior to diagnosis. Histology showed non‐seminoma (mature teratoma, 95%; embryonal carcinoma, <5%; and yolk sac tumour, <5%) in one case, pure seminoma grown into the rete testis in the second case, and a seminoma with syncytiotrophoblast cells in the third case. Tumour diameters ranged from 0.9 to 6.8 cm. None of the trans women had metastasis and all remained clinically stable after treatment. Two of the previously mentioned testicular cancer cases were discovered due to symptoms of a painless scrotal mass. Based on age‐specific incidence rates in cis men, we expected 2.4 cases of testicular cancer in our cohort. This resulted in a SIR of 0.8 with a 95% CI of 0.1–2.8. Subgroup analysis of 2731 trans women who initiated GAHT when aged ≥18 years, showed two testicular cancer cases, although 2.2 cases would have been expected, resulting in a SIR of 0.9 (95% CI 0.2–3.0). In the subgroup of 523 trans women with a follow‐up of ≥5 years (median [IQR] 8.9 [6.4–13.9] years, total 5870 years), no testicular cancer cases were observed, although 1.2 cases would have been expected based on the age‐specific incidence rates in cis men. Of the 1914 trans women who underwent bilateral orchidectomy, histopathological analysis of the resected specimens was performed in 722 trans women. Within this group, histopathological analysis showed testicular cancer in one case (0.1% of orchidectomy specimens obtained during GAS)."

        "section_name": "Discussion",
        "content": "The aim of the present study was to assess testicular cancer incidence in trans women using GAHT. A total of three testicular cancer cases were observed in our present cohort, of which two were discovered due to symptoms and the third was encountered during routine histopathological analysis of the bilateral orchidectomy specimen. Our observations suggest that there is no difference in testicular cancer risk between trans women using GAHT and cis men. In addition, no testicular cancer cases were observed in trans women with a follow‐up time of >5 years. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one other epidemiological study that, in addition to other types of cancer, also assessed testicular cancer incidence in trans women, reporting an incidence ratio of 0.3 (95% CI 0.1–0.6) compared to cis men [ 18 ]. However, in contrast to our present study this proportional incidence study lacked data on GAHT and GAS. As trans women are no longer at risk for testicular cancer after bilateral orchidectomy, we feel that with our longitudinal data we were able to accurately calculate follow‐up time, and hereby, adequately assess the effect of GAHT on testicular cancer risk. In total, five case reports have been published on testicular cancer cases in trans women. Histopathological analyses showed seminoma in three cases, non‐seminoma (mature teratoma) in one case, and mixed germ‐cell tumour (embryonal carcinoma, 75%; immature teratoma, 15%; seminoma, 9%; and yolk sac tumour, <1%) in the last case. Similar to the cases observed in our present cohort, two trans women were referred to urologists because they felt a painless scrotal mass which was, in one case, already present for several months [ 14 ,  16 ]. In the other three cases, testicular pathology was only discovered after extensive examination, initiated when antiandrogenic treatment failed to suppress serum testosterone concentrations [ 12 ,  13 ,  15 ]. This illustrates how diagnosis of testicular cancer in trans women may be delayed when people experience severe genital dysphoria and may ignore or be unaware of abnormalities such as a testicular mass. Furthermore, physicians might not be aware of the presence of testicles during a consultation with a phenotypical woman, which can also lead to a delayed diagnosis. Improving awareness on this topic is important to provide proper care for the increasing number of trans women who may not undergo genital GAS. In addition, it is imperative that healthcare providers are counselled on working in a trans sensitive manner [ 19 ,  20 ]. Furthermore, consistent with recommendations for cis men, trans women with clinical risk factors such as a family history of testicular cancer, should be encouraged to regularly perform testicular self‐examination [ 2 ,  21 ]. Several studies addressed the influence of GAHT on testicular tissue and mainly showed severe spermatogenic involution, reduced numbers of Leydig cells, seminiferous tubules with a decreased diameter or an absent lumen, heavy peritubular hyalinisation, and fibrosis [ 9 ]. Because of depletion of germ cells, testicular volumes have shown to generally decrease by 25% within the first year of hormonal treatment [ 22 ]. However, in previous studies, no malignant changes were observed in the orchidectomy specimens of trans women obtained during GAS [ 8 ,  23 ]. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of testicular cancer discovered during histopathological analysis of an orchidectomy specimen, even though our centre implemented routine histopathological analysis of orchidectomy specimens obtained during GAS ˜10 years ago. For trans women who underwent bilateral orchidectomy outside the Netherlands or before routine histopathological analysis was implemented, no histology results were available. As testicular cancer was discovered in only 0.1% of the 722 analysed orchidectomy specimens, one can argue if this routine histopathological analysis is necessary when there is no suspicion of testicular pathology. In literature, exposure to oestrogens has been implicated as a risk factor for germ‐cell tumours. Studies in rodents have shown that exposure to high oestrogen levels during either pre‐natal or adult life induces testicular tumour formation; however, it is unclear how such findings in animals apply to humans [ 24 ]. Several epidemiological studies have found a possible association between exposure to occupational and environmental oestrogenic chemicals, such as pesticides and other endocrine‐disrupting agents, and increased testicular cancer risk but require further confirmation [ 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  25 ]. Also, studies have investigated the association between high maternal oestrogen levels during the first trimester of pregnancy and the development of testicular cancer in offspring but failed to produce clear evidence for this oestrogen excess hypothesis [ 4 ,  26 ]. However, limitations of these studies include the indirect parameters that were used to assess the effect of oestrogen exposure such as maternal age >30 years, being first‐born, and twinning. We feel that, with our present study, we are able to more directly assess the influence of oestrogens on testicular cancer risk, as the most profound difference between our cohort and cis men is the use of gender‐affirming hormones. As we found that testicular cancer risk in trans women is not increased compared to cis men, our present results do not support the hypothesis of a carcinogenic effect of post‐natal exposure to exogenous oestrogens on testicular tissue. The major strengths of our present study include the large cohort size consisting of young people with an age range in the peak incidence of testicular cancer. Also, follow‐up time is adequately calculated by using the date that people were no longer at risk of testicular cancer or when they were last seen at our gender clinic. Furthermore, we were able to validate our data by linking our cohort to the PALGA, which has nationwide coverage [ 17 ]. Taken these factors into account, we feel that we are the first to report a reliable estimate of the testicular cancer risk in trans women. A limitation of the present study is that, despite the large cohort size, follow‐up time is relatively short due to the fact that the majority of trans women decided to undergo bilateral orchidectomy directly after the required minimum of 12 months GAHT. Nonetheless, within the subgroup of 523 trans women using hormonal treatment for ≥5 years (median [range] 8.9 [5.0–52.1] years), no testicular cancer cases were observed, implying that a longer duration of hormonal treatment does not contribute to an increased testicular cancer risk. It might be worthwhile to repeat this study in 10 years, to establish a larger cohort size and a longer follow‐up time, and consequently draw even more reliable conclusions on testicular cancer risk in trans women. Secondly, it was not possible to compare between GAHT protocols, as, on the one hand, many trans women change often between different types of prescribed oestrogens over time and, on the other hand, they mostly use cyproterone acetate as antiandrogenic treatment. Furthermore, scrotal ultrasonography to screen for the presence of testicular cancer was not routinely performed at initiation and during GAHT, but this was also not the case for the reference population, as guidelines advice against population‐based screening [ 2 ]. Therefore, we do not expect that this affected our present results. In conclusion, the present large nationwide cohort study in trans women using GAHT suggests that testicular cancer risk is comparable to the risk in cis men. Furthermore, results from our subgroup analysis in trans women with a long follow‐up period, suggest that longer exogenous oestrogen exposure does not increase the risk of developing testicular cancer. This is reassuring for trans women who do not wish, or do not have the option, to undergo genital GAS. However, awareness of the presence of the gonads remains important and regular testicular self‐examination is recommended."

    "abstract": "Introduction We sought to assess the impact of Affordable Care Act Dependent Care Expansion (ACA-DCE), which allowed dependent coverage for adults aged 19–25, and Medicaid expansion on outcomes for men with testicular cancer. Methods Using a US-based cancer registry, we performed adjusted difference-in-difference (DID) analyses comparing outcomes between men aged 19–25 (n = 8,026) and 26–64 (n = 33,303) pre- (2007–2009) and post-ACA-DCE (2011–2016) and between men in states that expanded Medicaid (n = 2,296) to men in those that did not (n = 2,265)pre- (2011–2013) and post-Medicaid expansion (2015–2016). Results In ACA-DCE analysis, rates of uninsurance decreased (DID -5.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.23 to -4.04%, p<0.001) among patients aged 19–25 relative to older patients aged 26–64. There was no significant DID in advanced stage at diagnosis (stage≥II; p = 0.6) or orchiectomy more than 14 days after diagnosis (p = 0.6). For patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy as their first course of treatment, treatment greater than 60 days after diagnosis decreased (DID -4.84%, 95% CI -8.22 to -1.45%, p = 0.005) among patients aged 19–25 relative to patients aged 26–64. In Medicaid expansion states, rates of uninsurance decreased (DID -4.20%, 95% CI -7.67 to -0.73%, p = 0.018) while patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy greater than 60 days after diagnosis decreased (DID -8.76, 95% CI -17.13 to -0.38%, p = 0.040) compared to rates in non-expansion states. No significant DIDs were seen for stage (p = 0.8) or time to orchiectomy (p = 0.1). Conclusions Men with testicular cancer had lower uninsurance rates and decreased time to delivery of chemotherapy or radiotherapy following ACA-DCE and Medicaid expansions. Time to orchiectomy and stage at diagnosis did not change following either insurance expansion.",

        "content": "Testicular cancer is the most common cancer among adolescent and young adult men [ 1 ]. Young adults have historically also had the highest rates of no health insurance in the US [ 2 ]. Among many factors contributing to long-term outcomes, being under-insured has been linked to worse cancer outcomes, in particular among young men [ 3 ]. Uninsured men with testicular cancer are more likely to present at later stages of disease and have worse mortality outcomes [ 4 ]. Additionally, insurance coverage impacts type of treatment received for testicular cancer [ 5 ]. Recently, changes in the Affordable Care Act Dependent Care Expansion (ACA-DCE) have significantly increased coverage and access to care for young adults between the ages of 19 and 25 [ 6 – 8 ]. Once these changes took effect in 2010, young adults were allowed to remain covered under their parents’ plans until the age of 26. Revisions to the ACA also allowed for several states to expand Medicaid eligibility to include U.S. citizens whose income falls below 133% of the federal poverty level and several did in January 2014. As of the 2017 fiscal year, over 12.6 million Americans were newly eligible and received coverage due to state expansion of Medicaid coverage [ 9 ]. Accordingly, rates of cancer patients without insurance decreased in states that expanded Medicaid relative to those in states that did not expand [ 3 ]. Previous works have assessed the associations between insurance expansion and outcomes specific to certain tumor types such as prostate and breast cancer [ 10 ,  11 ], which have shown differential benefits of insurance expansion for young patients with cancer depending on the cancer type. Thus, assessment of insurance expansion on outcomes for young patients with testicular cancer warrant investigations particularly since these patients present at young ages. To that end, we hypothesized the ACA-DCE in 2010 and widespread Medicaid expansion in 2014 impacted men presenting with testicular cancer by decreasing the percentage of those with no insurance and late stage disease (≥II). We also hypothesized insurance expansion was associated with decreases in the percentage of men receiving delayed treatment for testicular cancer. We were able to answer these questions using a large national dataset in the US to compare each outcome before and after each expansion."

        "content": "Institutional Review Board exemption was granted for this study from Northwestern University (STU00210266). Data were obtained and accessed on May 6, 2019 and these data were fully anonymized before access was available. Because the data were without any patient identifiers, no consents were obtained. The National Cancer Database is a hospital-based cancer registry in the United States organized by the American Cancer Society and the American College of Surgeons [ 12 ]. It captures data on over 70% of all new cancer in the United States. For the analysis of the ACA-DCE, we included all male patients (n = 49,221, 100%) diagnosed with testicular cancer ages 19–64 from 2007 to 2009 and 2011 to 2016. Patients were excluded if they had missing data on regional income or high school attainment (n = 666, 1.4%), insurance type (n = 959, 1.9%), or stage at diagnosis (n = 6,267, 12.7%). For the Medicaid expansion analysis, we included all male patients (n = 5,601, 100%) diagnosed with testicular cancer ages 40–64 from 2011 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016 residing in states that either expanded Medicaid on January 1, 2014 or never expanded Medicaid. In this analysis, there was only data available in the NCDB on Medicaid expansion for patients age 40 years or older. Patients were excluded if they had missing data on regional income or high school attainment (n = 71, 1.3%), insurance type (n = 88, 1.6%), or stage at diagnosis (n = 881, 15.7%). All independent variables were between-subjects. The main exposure of interest was year of diagnosis in both analyses: pre- (2007–2009) and post-ACA-DCE (2011–2013) and pre- (2011–2013) and post-Medicaid expansion (2015–2016). The years 2010 and 2014 were excluded as washout years for their respective expansions. Other covariates included in all adjusted regressions included race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or other/unknown), and Charlson/Deyo comorbidity index (0, 1, >1) [ 13 ]. Each regression was adjusted for zip code, median household income, and rate of adult high school attainment. These values were based on the 2012–2016 American Community Survey and were categorized based on quartiles relative to the entire United States. ( www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs ) Our outcomes included proportion of patients without insurance coverage, proportion of patients with advanced stage at diagnosis (American Joint Committee on Cancer edition 7; ≥II [ 14 ]) in those with staging information, days from diagnosis to orchiectomy in patients whose first treatment was orchiectomy (<14 versus ≥14 days), and days from diagnosis to chemotherapy or radiotherapy in patients whose first treatment was either chemotherapy or radiotherapy (<60 versus ≥60 days). In the absence of specific guidelines on treatment timing, the cutoffs for timing of treatment were chosen  a priori  as generally acceptable timeframes as reflections of favorable (earlier treatment) versus unfavorable (delayed treatment) access to healthcare. A simple pre- and post-exposure comparison of our outcomes of interest would not account for any factors external to insurance expansion. It would also not account for trends that were already present prior to expansion. Thus, we performed difference-in-difference (DID) analyses based on the exposure to insurance expansion [ 15 ]. This method addresses the issues of external factors that could affect outcomes by using a comparison group that experiences the same external factors but does not experience the exposure (insurance expansion). In the analysis of the ACA-DCE, patients were considered to be exposed to the “intervention” if they were age 19–25 at the time of diagnosis. Controls were those aged 26–64 as this age group would not have been affected by the ACA-DCE and would have been too young to receive Medicare [ 8 ]. In the Medicaid expansion analysis, patients were considered to be in the “intervention” group if they resided in a state that expanded Medicaid on January 1, 2014. Controls were those patients who resided in states that never expanded Medicaid. Using multivariable linear regression for each outcome with an interaction term between the intervention/controls and pre- and post-exposure years of diagnosis, we calculated the DID of the percentage for each outcome to assess how each outcome in the exposed groups changed relative the non-exposed groups before and after insurance expansion. A separate dummy variable was created for year of diagnosis for the pre-exposure years and the individual years following exposure for the ACA-DCE analysis (2015 alone and 2016 alone). This was not done for the Medicaid expansion analysis given the low numbers of patients. Subgroup analyses were performed limiting our analysis to patients living in zip code regions of low income (<$40,277 annual median household income). All statistical tests were performed using Stata 13 (College Station, TX) and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

Data were obtained and accessed on May 6, 2019 and these data were fully anonymized before access was available. Because the data were without any patient identifiers, no consents were obtained. The National Cancer Database is a hospital-based cancer registry in the United States organized by the American Cancer Society and the American College of Surgeons [ 12 ]. It captures data on over 70% of all new cancer in the United States. For the analysis of the ACA-DCE, we included all male patients (n = 49,221, 100%) diagnosed with testicular cancer ages 19–64 from 2007 to 2009 and 2011 to 2016. Patients were excluded if they had missing data on regional income or high school attainment (n = 666, 1.4%), insurance type (n = 959, 1.9%), or stage at diagnosis (n = 6,267, 12.7%). For the Medicaid expansion analysis, we included all male patients (n = 5,601, 100%) diagnosed with testicular cancer ages 40–64 from 2011 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016 residing in states that either expanded Medicaid on January 1, 2014 or never expanded Medicaid. In this analysis, there was only data available in the NCDB on Medicaid expansion for patients age 40 years or older. Patients were excluded if they had missing data on regional income or high school attainment (n = 71, 1.3%), insurance type (n = 88, 1.6%), or stage at diagnosis (n = 881, 15.7%)."

The main exposure of interest was year of diagnosis in both analyses: pre- (2007–2009) and post-ACA-DCE (2011–2013) and pre- (2011–2013) and post-Medicaid expansion (2015–2016). The years 2010 and 2014 were excluded as washout years for their respective expansions. Other covariates included in all adjusted regressions included race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or other/unknown), and Charlson/Deyo comorbidity index (0, 1, >1) [ 13 ]. Each regression was adjusted for zip code, median household income, and rate of adult high school attainment. These values were based on the 2012–2016 American Community Survey and were categorized based on quartiles relative to the entire United States. ( www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs )"

        "content": "A simple pre- and post-exposure comparison of our outcomes of interest would not account for any factors external to insurance expansion. It would also not account for trends that were already present prior to expansion. Thus, we performed difference-in-difference (DID) analyses based on the exposure to insurance expansion [ 15 ]. This method addresses the issues of external factors that could affect outcomes by using a comparison group that experiences the same external factors but does not experience the exposure (insurance expansion). In the analysis of the ACA-DCE, patients were considered to be exposed to the “intervention” if they were age 19–25 at the time of diagnosis. Controls were those aged 26–64 as this age group would not have been affected by the ACA-DCE and would have been too young to receive Medicare [ 8 ]. In the Medicaid expansion analysis, patients were considered to be in the “intervention” group if they resided in a state that expanded Medicaid on January 1, 2014. Controls were those patients who resided in states that never expanded Medicaid. Using multivariable linear regression for each outcome with an interaction term between the intervention/controls and pre- and post-exposure years of diagnosis, we calculated the DID of the percentage for each outcome to assess how each outcome in the exposed groups changed relative the non-exposed groups before and after insurance expansion. A separate dummy variable was created for year of diagnosis for the pre-exposure years and the individual years following exposure for the ACA-DCE analysis (2015 alone and 2016 alone). This was not done for the Medicaid expansion analysis given the low numbers of patients. Subgroup analyses were performed limiting our analysis to patients living in zip code regions of low income (<$40,277 annual median household income). All statistical tests were performed using Stata 13 (College Station, TX) and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

The median age at diagnosis for the patients age 19–25 years was 23 years vs 36 for patients age 26–64 years (p<0.001). In the 19–25 age group, fewer patients were white (70% vs 79%, p<0.001), more had zero comorbidities (95% vs 93%, p<0.001), and more resided in areas of low income and high non-high school attainment (both <0.001). Among those with information on treatment type and timing of treatment (n = 33,594), 18,996 (57%) received orchiectomy as their first treatment while 14,598 (43%) received chemotherapy or radiotherapy as their first form of treatment. Over the entire study period, 15% of patients age 19–25 years and 10% of those age 26–64 years had no insurance coverage ( S1 Table  and  Fig 1A ). The adjusted DID indicated rates of uninsurance decreased -5.64% (95% confidence interval [CI] -7.23 to -4.04%, p<0.001:  Table 1  and  S2 Table ) relative to older patients. Comparing the pre-ACA-DCE era (2007–2009) to the year 2016 revealed a DID of -7.43% (95% CI -10.12 to -4.73%, p = <0.001;  S3 Table ).

In total, 36% of patients age 19–25 and 27% of those age 26–64 presented with advanced disease (Stage ≥II) at diagnosis ( S1 Table  and  Fig 1B ). No significant changes in advanced disease was seen among all patients (p = 0.6) or those living in low income areas (p = 0.9:  Table 1  and  S2 Table ). Among patients who received orchiectomy as their first form of treatment, treatment was received 14 or more days after diagnosis for 9% of those age 19–25 and 10% of those age 26–64 ( S1 Table  and  Fig 1C ). No significant changes in days to orchiectomy was seen among all patients (p = 0.6) or those living in low income areas (p = 0.4:  Table 1  and  S2 Table ). Among patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy as their first form of treatment, treatment was received 60 or more days after diagnosis for 21% of patients age 19–25 and 21% of those age 26–64 ( S1 Table  and  Fig 1D ). Adjusted DID analysis showed a decrease in this figure of -4.84% (95% CI -8.22 to -1.45%, p = 0.005;  Table 1  and  S2 Table ).

Vertical lines demarcate when state-dependent participation in Medicaid Expansion began. A total of 28% of patients in the expansion states and 31% of those in non-expansion states presented with advanced disease (Stage ≥II) at diagnosis ( S4 Table  and  Fig 2B ).

Among patients who received orchiectomy as their first form of treatment, treatment was received 14 or more days after diagnosis for 13% of patients in expansion states and 11% of those in non-expansion states ( S4 Table  and  Fig 2C ). There was no significant change in overall time to orchiectomy following expansion (p = 0.1;  Table 1  and  S5 Table ).

        "content": "In this retrospective study, we used data from a national cancer registry to identify changes in the rate of insurance coverage, stage at diagnosis, and time to treatment in male patients diagnosed with testicular cancer following both the ACA-DCE and Medicaid expansion. Compared to the control group, patients age 19–25 and those in Medicaid expansion states experienced a significant decrease in rates of uninsurance following ACA-DCE in 2010 and Medicaid expansion in 2014, respectively. They both, likewise, experienced decreases in time to treatment for those whose first treatment was chemotherapy or radiotherapy relative to controls. There were no decreases noted in stage at diagnosis or time to treatment for those whose first treatment was orchiectomy. The ACA-DCE and Medicaid expansions have prompted an examination of the effects of increased insurance coverage on cancer outcomes. There has been a significant decrease in the percentage of uninsured, non-elderly patients with newly diagnosed cancer following implementation of the ACA in both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states, but with greater magnitude in Medicaid expansion states [ 3 ,  16 ]. A more recent study showed higher insurance rates did not result in changes in time to treatment for young women with breast cancer [ 10 ]. Notably, though, among patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer, Medicaid expansion was associated with decreases in the proportion of patients presenting with high-risk disease [ 11 ]. Thus, recent insurance expansions may differentially impact patients with different cancer. Because testicular cancer is ordinarily diagnosed at a relatively young age [ 1 ], insurance expansion via the ACA-DCE and Medicaid expansion had substantial potential to positively impact patients with newly diagnosed testicular cancer. According to recent reports, young men aged 20–34 have the highest incidence of being both uninsured and diagnosed with testicular cancer [ 17 – 19 ]. Additionally, previous work that analyzed data collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Reports database demonstrated lack of insurance in patients with testicular cancer increases risk of presenting with advanced stage disease, which is associated with worse mortality [ 4 ,  20 ]. This makes young men with testicular cancer a vulnerable population, yet likely to benefit from recent insurance expansions. Our analysis indicates decreases in the rates of uninsured patients with testicular cancer with following both ACA-DCE and Medicaid expansion. However, our findings also indicate neither policy change was associated with earlier staging at diagnosis. This is in contrast to prior studies indicating reductions in uninsured rates and late stage disease for all young patients with cancer following the ACA-DCE [ 16 ,  21 ,  22 ]. These inconsistencies may be in part due to relatively short term follow up data following each policy change. Longer-term follow-up may continue to show improvements in insurance coverage and outcomes for patients with testicular cancer including survival. Notably, the rates of uninsurance or stage at diagnosis did not measurably change among men from regions of low annual income. However, the number of men in these analyses were small for both expansions ( S1  and  S4  Tables ). Lack of data from patients age 19–40 in the Medicaid expansion dataset likely reduced the power of the Medicaid expansion analysis. Additionally, men from backgrounds of higher socioeconomic status and previous insurance coverage in childhood were more likely to take advantage of the ACA-DCE and parental coverage [ 23 ]. Further work is needed to understand the benefits of insurance expansion on men of low socioeconomic status. In addition to staging, earlier treatment has also been linked to better survival and disease outcomes [ 24 ]. Prior studies have demonstrated insurance expansion is associated with improvements in access and timeliness of treatment for pancreatic, thyroid, and colorectal cancer [ 25 ,  26 ]. Mirroring these results, our findings noted ACA-DCE and Medicaid expansion were associated with a decrease in time to treatment in men whose first treatment was either chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Additionally, men from regions of low annual income experienced decreases in time to treatment if their first treatment was orchiectomy. These results are encouraging and may reflect ongoing positive trends in more timely treatment for men with testicular cancer. Several limitations should be taken into consideration when reviewing this study’s findings. First, NCDB only includes data from Commission on Cancer-accredited US hospitals. Accredited hospitals are more likely to be larger and have more cancer-related services available to patients, thus results may not be generalizable to the overall population [ 27 ]. Second, only information for men age 40 years or older was available for the Medicaid expansion analysis. Given the highest incidence of testicular cancer occurs in men aged 20–44 with a median of 33 years old, this limits the generalizability of these findings to all young men diagnosed with testicular cancer [ 17 ]. Third, relatively short-term follow-up data in conjunction with inclusion of the years of implementation for each policy change may have biased the results in ways that are difficult to ascertain. There were likely inevitable logistical delays in transitioning in new policy, which may have delayed changes in patients’ access to care. Fourth, our outcomes are all still proxies for more meaningful oncologic outcomes such as cancer-specific survival and morbidities related to advanced stage cancer diagnosis. Additionally, unbalanced age at diagnosis between in the comparison groups in the ACA-DCE analysis may create inherent bias given all patients age 19 to 25 years would have benefited from ACA-DCE, thus an older “control” group was required. Several unmeasured relevant variables not included in the NCDB that may have affected our outcomes warrant mentioning including individual-level measurements of socioeconomic status, smoking history and body-mass index among others. The current study was also limited by relatively small sample sizes and short follow-up leading to reduced patient numbers for subgroup analyses. For this reason, ongoing work should continue to evaluate the differential effects of insurance expansion for vulnerable patient groups based on race and ethnicity. Finally, we acknowledge a large percentage of patients who were described as receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy as their first form of treatment. This finding likely reflects either a selection bias based on recorded treatments or timing to treatments in the NCDB. It may also reflect a lack of recording orchiectomy if, for instance, the orchiectomy was performed prior to presentation to the NCDB facility. Thus, some of the patients recorded as receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy as their first treatment may have received those treatments as adjuvant treatments. In summary, data from the NCDB revealed ACA-DCE and Medicaid expansion were associated with decreases in the percentage of uninsured men with testicular cancer. Despite this, no association was found between either expansion and the staging of disease at diagnosis. However, both expansions were associated with decreases in time to treatment for men whose first treatment was chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Moving forward, future research should attempt to identify additional variables affecting testicular cancer outcomes such as race and education. Longer-term follow up should continue to assess outcomes for men with testicular cancer related to insurance expansions. Additionally, examination of the impact of insurance expansion on survival outcomes would offer a more comprehensive analysis on oncologic outcomes."

        "content": "In a national cohort of men with testicular cancer, ACA-DCE and Medicaid expansion were each independently associated with decreases in rates of uninsurance, but no association with stage at diagnosis was found. Both expansions were associated with improvements in time to treatment in patients whose first treatment was chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Further understanding of the impact insurance expansions have had on healthcare for men with testicular cancer warrants longer-term follow up, inclusion of more patients aged 19–40 for Medicaid expansion analysis, and addition of cancer-specific survival outcomes."

    "title": "Long-term quality of life of testicular cancer survivors differs according to applied adjuvant treatment and tumour type",
    "abstract": "Purpose To evaluate the quality of life (QoL) in long-term testicular cancer (TC) survivors. Methods QoL was assessed in TC survivors treated between March 1976 and December 2004 ( n  = 625) using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire, including a TC module. The assessment was performed at two time points (2006: response rate:  n  = 201/625 (32.2%), median follow-up (FU): 12.9 years (range 1.1–30.9); 2017: response rate:  n  = 95/201 (47.3%), median FU: 26.2 years (range: 13.0–41.2)). TC survivors were grouped according to treatment strategy, tumour entity, clinical stage and prognosis group. Linear and multiple linear regression analyses were performed, with age and time of follow-up as possible confounders. Results Radiation therapy (RT) compared to retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) was associated with a higher impairment of physical function (2017:  β  =  − 9.038; t(84) =  − 2.03;  p  = 0.045), role function (2017:  β  =  − 12.764; t(84) =  − 2.00;  p  = 0.048), emotional function (2006:  β  =  − 9.501; t(183) =  − 2.09;  p  = 0.038) and nausea (2006:  β  = 6.679; t(185) = 2.70;  p  = 0.008). However, RT was associated with a lower impairment of sexual enjoyment (2017: symptoms:  β  = 26.831; t(64) = 2.66;  p  = 0.010; functional:  β  = 22.983; t(65) = 2.36;  p  = 0.021). Chemotherapy (CT), compared to RPLND was associated with a higher impairment of role (2017:  β  =  − 16.944; t(84) =  − 2.62;  p  = 0.011) and social function (2017: β =  − 19.160; t(79) =  − 2.56;  p  = 0.012), more insomnia (2017:  β  = 19.595; t(84) = 2.25;  p  = 0.027) and greater concerns about infertility (2017: β = 19.830; t(80) = 2.30;  p  = 0.024). In terms of tumour type, nonseminomatous germ cell tumour (NSGCT) compared to seminoma survivors had significantly lower impairment of nausea (2006:  β  =  − 4.659; t(187) =  − 2.17;  p  = 0.031), appetite loss (2006: β =  − 7.554; t(188) =  − 2.77;  p  = 0.006) and future perspective (2006:  β  =  − 12.146; t(175) =  − 2.08;  p  = 0.039). On the other hand, surviving NSGCT was associated with higher impairment in terms of sexual problems (2006:  β  = 16.759; t(145) = 3.51;  p  < 0.001; 2017:  β  = 21.207; t(63) = 2.73;  p  = 0.008) and sexual enjoyment (2017:  β  =  − 24.224; t(66) =  − 2.76;  p  = 0.008). Conclusions The applied adjuvant treatment and the tumour entity had a significant impact on the long-term QoL of TC survivors, even more than 25 years after the completion of therapy. Both RT and CT had a negative impact compared to survivors treated with RPLND, except for sexual concerns. NSGCT survivors had a lower impairment of QoL compared to seminoma survivors, except in terms of sexual concerns. Implications for Cancer Survivors Implications for cancer survivors are to raise awareness of aspects of long-term and late effects on QoL in TC survivors; offer supportive care, such as psycho-oncological support or lifestyle modification, if a deterioration in QoL is noticed; and avoid toxic treatment without compromising a cure whenever possible.

        "content": "Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common solid malignancy in young men, with rising incidence rates [ 1 ]. As the disease has an excellent cure rate and affects mostly young men, TC survivors bear a significant risk of suffering from long-term consequences of therapy [ 2 ,  3 ]. There is a wide spectrum of adjuvant therapies that we can offer TC patients, including surveillance strategies, chemotherapy (CT) and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) [ 4 ]. Additionally, radiotherapy (RT) is in the armamentarium for TC treatment, and its use has continuously declined in recent decades due to severe concerns about long-term effects on morbidity and mortality [ 5 ]. Today, the majority of TC patients recover from acute side effects. However, it is the late adverse effects that have the greatest impact on long-term quality of life (QoL) and survival. Health-related QoL has become an important topic in clinical oncology in general, and especially in TC. Most cross-sectional studies have described a QoL in TC survivors comparable to that in the non-cancer population [ 6 ,  7 ]. However, little is known about how different therapeutic modalities impact the QoL of long-term TC survivors. The aim of our study was to evaluate health-related QoL in long-term survivors of TC, with a special emphasis on the applied adjuvant treatment strategies, tumour type, clinical stage and prognosis group."

In 2006, 52 (28.3%) patients reported arterial hypertension, and in 2017 47 (51.1%). Hyperlipidaemia was reported in 51 (29.8%, 2006) and 32 (35.2%, 2017) patients, respectively; and 22 (11.3%, 2006) and 17 (18.1%, 2017) patients reported having fathered children after diagnosis (Table  1 ). The applied radiation dose ranged from 20 to 30 Gy; however, this was only known from 30 patients. The most often applied CT regimen was PEB, with two to four cycles being administered. The global QoL was 70.8 (± 20.6) in 2006 and 70.5 (± 21.4) in 2017. For the results of the different scales of the QLQ-C30 at the two different time points, see Suppl.  1 .

In terms of symptom scales, patients in 2017 had significantly higher mean values of fatigue (24.8 (± 25.4) vs. 18.5 (± 21.9),  p -value = 0.025) and dyspnoea (19.0 (± 28.6) vs. 13.2 (± 21.6),  p -value = 0.048) (see Suppl.  2 ). Concerning TC-specific scales, the score for body image problems was significantly higher in 2017 (28.4 (± 36.5) vs. 19.5 (± 27.2),  p -value = 0.016) (see Suppl.  2 ). Survivors receiving RT compared to RPLND had significantly poorer global health (2006:  p  = 0.025), including lower physical (2006:  p  = 0.017) and emotional function scores (2006:  p  = 0.014). They had significantly worse QoL concerning fatigue (2006:  p  = 0.014), nausea (2006:  p  = 0.006), pain (2006:  p  = 0.019), insomnia (2006:  p  = 0.031), appetite loss (2006:  p  = 0.025) and constipation (2006:  p  = 0.014). Some of these differences were still seen even with longer follow-up: a poorer global health status (2017,  p  = 0.047) as well as physical (2017:  p  = 0.019), role (2017:  p  = 0.022) and emotional function scores (2017:  p  = 0.046). RT was additionally associated with a higher impairment of body image problems (2017:  p  = 0.037). However, RT patients showed lower impairment in terms of sexual enjoyment (2017: symptoms:  p  = 0.004; functional:  p  = 0.011) (see Table  2  and Fig.  2 A,  B ).\n Table 2 Results of the QLQ-C30 and TC module according to applied adjuvant therapy.

However, RT was associated with lower impairment in terms of sexual enjoyment (2017: symptom:  β  = 26.831; t(64) = 2.66;  p  = 0.010; functional:  β  = 22.983; t(65): 2.36;  p  = 0.021) (see Table  2  and Fig.  2 A,  B ). With longer follow-up CT survivors had significantly lower role (2017:  p  = 0.040) and social function scores (2017:  p  = 0.018). Additionally, CT was associated with worse insomnia (2017:  p  = 0.021) and greater concerns about infertility (2017:  p  = 0.016) (see Table  2  and Fig.  2 A,  B ). All of these observations remained statistically significant after multiple testing with worse role function (2017:  β  =  − 16.944; t(84) =  − 2.62;  p  = 0.011) and social function scores (2017:  β  =  − 16.944; t(84) =  − 2.62;  p  = 0.011; 2017:  β  =  − 19.160; t(79) =  − 2.56;  p  = 0.012), worse insomnia (2017:  β  = 19.595; t(84) = 2.25;  p  = 0.027) and more concerns about infertility (2017:  β  = 19.830; t(80) = 2.30;  p  = 0.024) (see Table  2  and Fig.  2 A,  B ) in CT survivors. Compared to seminoma survivors, NSGCT survivors had a significantly better QoL concerning global health (2006:  p  = 0.005), including physical (2006:  p  = 0.004) and emotional function (2006:  p  = 0.047). Additionally, NSGCT survivors were less impaired by nausea (2006:  p  = 0.033), pain (2006:  p  = 0.012), dyspnoea (2006:  p  = 0.018) and appetite loss (2006:  p  = 0.001). They reported fewer body image problems (2006:  p  = 0.024) and concerns about the future (2006:  p  = 0.043). None of these differences were seen with longer follow-up in 2017. However, sexual problems (2006:  p  = 0.005; 2017:  p  = 0.019) and impairment of sexual enjoyment (2006:  p  = 0.047; 2017:  p  = 0.003) were worse at both follow-up time points. Treatment satisfaction was higher in NSGCT survivors (2017:  p  = 0.017) (see Suppl.  3  and Suppl.  6 A and B). After correcting for age and length of follow-up as confounding parameters, NSGCT survivors still had less nausea and appetite loss (2006:  β  =  − 4.659; t(187) =  − 2.17;  p  = 0.031; β =  − 7.554; t(188) =  − 2.77;  p  = 0.006). Additionally, they were less concerned about the future (2006:  β  =  − 12.146; t(175) =  − 2.08;  p  = 0.039). Sexual problems (2006:  β  = 16.759; t(145) = 3.51;  p  < 0.001; 2017:  β  = 21.207; t(63) = 2.73;  p  = 0.008) and impairment of sexual enjoyment (2017:  β  =  − 24.224; t(66) =  − 2.76;  p  = 0.008) were more frequent (see Suppl.  3  and Suppl.  6 A and B). There were hardly any differences in QoL between survivors according to clinical stage. Metastasized patients had fewer body image problems (2006:  p  = 0.019; β =  − 9.511; t(173) =  − 2.00;  p  = 0.047). However, they were more impaired by sexual problems (2006:  p  = 0.024;  β  = 15.002; t(143) = 3.09;  p  = 0.002) (see Suppl.  4 ). There were no noteworthy differences concerning the prognosis group in formerly metastasized survivors. Of note, the numbers of survivors with an intermediate and poor prognosis were very low (see Suppl.  5 )."

When comparing the different scores of the survivors who responded to both questionnaires, the mean global QoL (74.8 (± 18.7) vs. 70.5 (± 21.7),  p -value = 0.048), physical function (93.0 (± 12.2) vs. 87.5 (± 18.6),  p -value = 0.001) and role function (89.6 (± 18.9) vs. 83.3 (± 25.5),  p -value = 0.010) were significantly lower in the responses from 2017 compared to 2006 (see Suppl.  2 ). In terms of symptom scales, patients in 2017 had significantly higher mean values of fatigue (24.8 (± 25.4) vs. 18.5 (± 21.9),  p -value = 0.025) and dyspnoea (19.0 (± 28.6) vs. 13.2 (± 21.6),  p -value = 0.048) (see Suppl.  2 ). Concerning TC-specific scales, the score for body image problems was significantly higher in 2017 (28.4 (± 36.5) vs. 19.5 (± 27.2),  p -value = 0.016) (see Suppl.  2 )."

        "content": "Many studies report on QoL in TC. However, reports on long-term QoL are sparse and there are only limited reports on the effects of applied adjuvant therapies [ 11 – 19 ]. Furthermore, many reports are lacking sufficient quality in reporting results, i.e., standardizing the assessment of QoL or testing multiple times. We hereby present a study with the so far longest follow-up in terms of QoL in TC survivors. According to our study, all investigated adjuvant therapies for the treatment of TC impact long-term QoL even though different aspects of QoL are affected. Additionally, the tumour type, probably confounded by the difference in applied adjuvant therapies, impacts long-term QoL. The clinical stage and prognosis group had an only minor impact on long-term QoL. After a median follow-up of 13 years, RT compared to RPLND was associated with impairment of emotional function and nausea, independently of age and length of follow-up. With a longer median follow-up of 26 years, there was an impairment in physical function. In the long run, RPLND compared to RT was associated with a higher impairment of sexual enjoyment. Most studies on the emotional function of TC survivors report moderate to high levels of stress, depression and anxiety [ 20 ]. However, there only exist a few reports on the effects of the applied adjuvant treatments on later emotional well-being [ 11 ,  21 ,  22 ]. When comparing to other treatment modalities, Rudberg et al. reported that TC survivors treated with CT reported lower emotional well-being after a median follow-up of 8 years [ 11 ]. Fossa et al. reported similar results 3 years after therapy, in patients who were treated with both CT and RT [ 21 ]. Stuart et al. found a higher rate of depression in TC survivors who received RT [ 22 ]. According to our results, only TC survivors who received RT reported worse emotional well-being 13 years after treatment. All these studies differed in the length of follow-up. However, our study was the only one that corrected for age and length of follow-up. Both CT and RT are well known to be associated with nausea as an acute side effect. However, the long-term and late outcome may also be affected. Fossa et al., already in 1988, reported a higher amount of nausea and vomiting in RT patients compared to those receiving surgery alone or CT 3 years after therapy [ 21 ]. We observed the same in our study, even after a median follow-up of 13 years regarding TC survivors. Of interest, Fossa et al. reported a raised death rate in germ cell tumour survivors due to benign gastrointestinal disorders [ 23 ]. Abdominal RT contributed considerably to this risk [ 23 ,  24 ]. They found out that gastroduodenal ulcers, as a long-term toxicity of RT, not only represent a significant morbidity but may also be a cause of death [ 23 ]. Interestingly, we found a reduction in physical function even 26 years after treatment in the RT group. It is well known that RT may lead to a reduction in physical function, mainly because the body is exposed to large amounts of cell debris and degradation products [ 25 ]. Nevertheless, it is astonishing that this phenomenon is detectable more than 25 years after the completion of treatment. However, late effects of treatment are generally considered irreversible and progressive over time [ 26 ]. We noticed a significantly worse outcome for RPLND compared to RT TC survivors in terms of sexual enjoyment 26 years after treatment. RPLND may be associated with andrological complications, the most important being retrograde ejaculation [ 27 ]. In terms of primary RPLND, the percentage of retrograde ejaculation ranges between 1 and 61% [ 27 ]. Erectile dysfunction after TC treatment seems to be a temporary impairment, as Capogrosso et al. reported a median time of erectile function recovery of 60, 60 and 70 months respectively for CT, RT and RPLND [ 28 ]. Aspects of sexual function, such as sexual activity or sexual problems, did not significantly differ between the adjuvant treatment modalities in our study. Nevertheless, it is likely that such problems may have an impact on sexual enjoyment and that this would affect primary RPLND more seriously than RT TC survivors. Rudberg et al. reported deteriorated sexual functioning in 14% of TC survivors after a mean follow-up of 8 years. Additionally, they found significantly lower sexual interest and a lower ability to enjoy sex in survivors who had undergone the treatment combination of RT plus CT and/or RPLND compared to other treatments [ 11 ]. Kim et al., after a median follow-up of 14 years, reported that CT increased the risk of sexual dysfunction in terms of delayed ejaculation, problem assessment and erectile dysfunction compared to non-cancer controls [ 29 ]. CT compared to RPLND, after a median follow-up of 26 years, was associated with a higher impairment of role and social function, insomnia and concerns about infertility. We found role function, which is the ability to engage in work/household as well as leisure activities, to be significantly impaired in TC survivors receiving CT compared to RPLND. Van Leeuwen et al. reported on a significant minority of TC survivors who experienced work-related changes, especially affecting survivors with mental and physical health problems [ 30 ]. In contradiction to our own findings, Arai et al. reported a better working ability in survivors receiving CT and RT compared to those on surveillance at a median follow-up of 8 years. Moreover, survivors who underwent CT and RPLND reported the best working ability [ 31 ]. However, no standardized questionnaire was used. Kaasa et al. found no differences according to the treatment group at a mean of 5 years after therapy [ 32 ]. Ozen et al. reported a worse professional life for 17% of TC survivors when treated with RT and of 6% when treated with CT at a median follow-up of 5 years. However, a statistically significant effect of treatment modality was not observed [ 33 ]. In our study, social function in TC survivors treated with CT compared to RPLND was significantly impaired after a median follow-up of 26 years. Kim et al. reported the same observation when comparing to non-cancer controls after a median follow-up of 14 years, as assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire. However, in a multivariate analysis, their results could not be confirmed [ 14 ]. Vidrine et al. also reported significantly lower social function in patients treated with CT compared to surveillance at 3 and 12 months [ 13 ]. Nevertheless, in our evaluation, at only 13 years of follow-up, we found no such association. According to our results, CT treatment may contribute to a decreased ability to integrate and interact with others, even more than 20 years after treatment. Additionally, survivors treated with CT compared to RPLND reported greater insomnia, even 26 years after treatment. There is some evidence that sleep disturbance negatively affects health and may be associated with increased mortality [ 34 ,  35 ]. Bumbasirevic et al. reported insomnia and financial difficulties as the most important effects that accounted for the worse QoL of TC survivors after a follow-up of 4 years [ 36 ]. Douchez et al., after 9 years of follow-up, found that about 30% of an NSGCT survivor collective reported insomnia [ 37 ]. Oechsle et al. also reported on sleep disturbances in 36% of TC survivors 12 years after therapy [ 15 ]. It is well known that some oncologic treatments may increase the risk of developing insomnia, either because of the emotional impact, the direct physiologic effects or the side effects [ 34 ]. Circulating plasma platinum is detectable in TC survivors even 20 years after the administration of CT [ 38 ], and there is evidence that cisplatin concentration correlates with the development of late effects including neurologic disturbances in TC survivors [ 39 ]. Interestingly, survivors who received CT were more concerned about infertility, even 26 years after treatment, compared to survivors who received RPLND. Yamashita et al. evaluated TC survivors with the QLQ-TC26 questionnaire and noticed a significant reduction in concerns about infertility in CT + RPLND survivors more than 10 years after treatment compared to less than 5 years after treatment [ 12 ]. In our survivor collective, we did not notice the same trend when a correlation analysis was performed (data not shown). NSGCT survivors had less nausea and appetite loss and were less concerned about the future compared to seminoma survivors after a median follow-up of 13 years. However, sexual problems and impairment of sexual enjoyment were more frequent, even at 26 years of follow-up. Concerning tumour entity, Kim et al. found NSGCT survivors, compared to non-cancer controls, to be at higher risk in terms of sexual, erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction as well as problem assessment [ 29 ]. Jovanovski et al. reported on a possible increase in physical function among NSGCT survivors and a decrease in mental function over time since the cancer diagnosis [ 40 ]. Possible explanations for the differences in terms of tumour entity include different ages at diagnosis, with seminoma patients being on average older than NSGCT patients, and different applied adjuvant therapies. As we corrected for age and length of follow-up, age as an influencing factor should be of minor importance. Thus, the different treatment regimens applied should best explain our findings. We found NSGCT survivors to have less nausea and appetite loss compared to seminoma survivors, probably due to less RT being used. However, sexual problems and impairment of sexual enjoyment were more frequent in NSGCT survivors, corresponding to the higher amount of RPLND being used. Furthermore, NSGCT survivors were less concerned about the future. The knowledge on the possible affection of long-term QoL in TC survivors stresses the importance of assessing their long-term QoL. This opens the door to offer supportive care, such as psycho-oncological support or lifestyle modifications. Additionally, it once again emphasizes the importance of a further reduction in treatment-related toxicity of TC patients without compromising cure, whenever possible. Our study has several limitations. Survivors on surveillance are underrepresented in our study as surveillance regimens only gained importance in Germany after 2004. Thus, conclusions about adjuvant surveillance cannot be drawn from our study. In terms of adjuvant therapies, we did not discriminate between patients who had CT + RPLND (about 50% in each questionnaire group) and patients who only had CT as adjuvant treatment. We did not know the exact amount of radiation and CT applied in the RT and CT survivor collective. Primary RPLND served as the control group when comparing adjuvant treatment modalities. However, only patients in early stages of the disease receive primary RPLND. Nevertheless, in our analysis the impact of clinical stage or prognosis group on QoL was of only minor importance. There was a lack of assessment of sociodemographic parameters such as education, employment or family life as these questions were only implemented in the second questionnaire. We therefore decided not to report on them. The TC module we used as a supplement to the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire was not validated during that time. Later, it was replaced by the validated EORTC QLQ-TC26 questionnaire. There was an essential change to one question: “Was sex less enjoyable for you compared to before your illness?” was changed to “To what extent was sex enjoyable to you?” [ 41 ]. The negative phrasing of the former question might have been misunderstood by some patients and thus might have provoked misleading answers."

        "content": "Seminomatous germ cell tumors (GCTs) are highly responsive to cisplatin-based chemotherapy as well as to radiotherapy. However, these treatments are linked to several adverse long-term side effects such as cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, pulmonary, neurological, and infertility complications, as well as an increased risk of inducing secondary malignancies  [1] ,  [2] ,  [3] . As a result, individuals who have survived metastatic GCTs experience long-term excess mortality  [3] ,  [4] . Young patients, expected to have a long lifespan, are predominantly affected. As metastases of seminoma are often limited to retroperitoneal lymph nodes  [5] , retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is a compelling treatment modality with a reduced risk of late toxicity-related sequelae. Surgical treatment in metastatic seminoma patients has been evaluated in the prospective trials SEMS, PRIMETEST, and CO-TRIMS  [6] ,  [7] ,  [8] . Additionally, several retrospective series have been published from high-volume centers  [9] ,  [10] . Performed in specialized surgical units, RPLND is a treatment option associated with relatively low rates of complications and few enduring effects, with the loss of antegrade ejaculation as the most prominent adverse long-term outcome  [11] ,  [12] ,  [13] . In theory, RPLND emerges as a favorable treatment option for seminoma patients with low-volume metastatic spread to reduce the extended morbidity and excess mortality associated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The Swedish Norwegian Testicular Cancer Group (SWENOTECA) of oncologists and urologists has, since 1981, provided population-based guidelines and studies for patients with testicular GCTs in Sweden and Norway. The current guidelines, SWENOTECA X, implemented in 2020 recommends primary unilateral nerve-sparing RPLND in modified Royal Marsden clinical stage (CS) Mk+ and IIA-B (≤3 cm in any dimension and no more than two enlarged lymph nodes)  [14] . For staging and treatment decisions, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is recommended and combined with conventional computerized tomography (CT; see  Fig. 1 ). After RPLND, in case of tumor extension beyond 3 cm and/or two lymph nodes, positive margins, or perinodal growth in the pathology report, adjuvant therapy with one cycle of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) is recommended. Fig. 1 Flowchart from management program SWENOTECA X, 2020, www.swenoteca.org. BEP = bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin; CS = clinical stage; FDG-PET = fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography; RPLND = retroperitoneal lymph node dissection; SWENOTECA = Swedish Norwegian Testicular Cancer Group.

In this report, we present the results from the initial cohort of 62 patients who underwent RPLND as primary treatment according to the SWENOTECA X protocol for low-volume metastatic seminoma. The objective was to assess the surgical and oncological outcomes of RPLND as a treatment option for this patient group."

        "content": "This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively enrolled cohort. Adult patients with pure seminoma tumor in the orchiectomy specimen, with CS IIA or IIB by Royal Marsden classification  [15] , with one to two lymph nodes of maximum 3 cm size (in any dimension) in the retroperitoneum, either at relapse after CS I or at primary metastatic disease, were included from November 2019 to December 2022. Elevated beta human chorionic gonadotropin prior to RPLND was allowed. A preoperative FDG-PET/CT scan was recommended and considered positive if a metastasis exhibited significant hyperbolic metabolism. All patients were discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board regarding treatment decision. RPLND was performed using either laparoscopic robot-assisted or open surgical technique. The decision regarding the surgical approach was made by the urologist considering the patient’s clinical factors. Surgical templates were used according to the SWENOTECA X guidelines  [14] . The right-side template covers the areas below the renal vessels, to the right of the cava, the retrocaval and interaortocaval spaces, and medial to the right ureter. It extends caudally to the aortic bifurcation and to the point where the right ureter crosses the iliac vessels. The left-side template covers the areas below the renal vessels, the retroaortic space, anterior to and to the left of the aorta, and medial to the left ureter. It extends caudally to the aortic bifurcation and to the point where the left ureter crosses the iliac vessels. In addition, both the right and the left template include the ipsilateral testicular vein, from its origin to the profound inguinal orifice. Nerve sparing was at least carried out through a strict template dissection, preserving nerves outside template borders. If deemed possible, a nerve-sparing technique was also employed within templates for all patients. All surgeons had substantial experience in both open and robot-assisted RPLND. Surgery was performed in five tertiary hospitals in Norway and Sweden. The exclusion criteria were elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels, retroperitoneal mass exceeding 3 cm or more than two enlarged lymph nodes on FDG-PET/CT, previous RPLND, former radiotherapy to the abdomen or former chemotherapy other than one adjuvant course of BEP (administered within the SWENOTECA ABC-study  [16] ), or one course of carboplatin. Data collection was approved by regional ethics committees. The postoperative follow-up included CT of the thorax and abdomen and serum tumor markers at 3 mo, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the retroperitoneum and serum tumor markers at 6 mo, and repeated MRI and tumor markers every 6 mo for the first 2 yr. Thereafter, markers were controlled every 6 mo and MRI of the abdomen was performed annually for 5 yr. X-rays of the thorax were taken at 12, 36, and 60 mo. Clinical parameters collected were age, CS, serum tumor marker levels, radiological examination results, histopathological reports, and adjuvant chemotherapies. Time of follow-up was described using median and interquartile range (IQR). Surgical details included template, side, approach, blood loss, operating time, duration of hospital stay, and postoperative complications. Post-RPLND complications were defined using the Clavien-Dindo classification  [17] . The statistical analysis and graphical representations were conducted using STATA v16.1 (StataCorp LCC, College Station, TX, USA). Follow-up started at the time of surgery and ended at the time of relapse or at the last follow-up, whichever came first. A survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate and compare survival curves between two groups. Subsequently, the log-rank test was applied to assess the statistical significance of observed differences in survival times. The groups were CS, receivers of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, and post-RPLND relapse. Kaplan-Meier probability estimates were employed to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). At cohort definition, future postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy status was unknown, resulting in Kaplan-Meier curve stratification based on post-time-zero variables, a potential limitation. To assess proportional differences within the individual group of relapses, a one-sided binominal test was utilized for CS, side of testicular tumor, surgical approach, and perinodal tumor growth. Statistical significance was reached at a level of  p  < 0.05 for one- and two-tailed analyses."

Adult patients with pure seminoma tumor in the orchiectomy specimen, with CS IIA or IIB by Royal Marsden classification  [15] , with one to two lymph nodes of maximum 3 cm size (in any dimension) in the retroperitoneum, either at relapse after CS I or at primary metastatic disease, were included from November 2019 to December 2022. Elevated beta human chorionic gonadotropin prior to RPLND was allowed. A preoperative FDG-PET/CT scan was recommended and considered positive if a metastasis exhibited significant hyperbolic metabolism. All patients were discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board regarding treatment decision. RPLND was performed using either laparoscopic robot-assisted or open surgical technique. The decision regarding the surgical approach was made by the urologist considering the patient’s clinical factors. Surgical templates were used according to the SWENOTECA X guidelines  [14] . The right-side template covers the areas below the renal vessels, to the right of the cava, the retrocaval and interaortocaval spaces, and medial to the right ureter. It extends caudally to the aortic bifurcation and to the point where the right ureter crosses the iliac vessels. The left-side template covers the areas below the renal vessels, the retroaortic space, anterior to and to the left of the aorta, and medial to the left ureter. It extends caudally to the aortic bifurcation and to the point where the left ureter crosses the iliac vessels. In addition, both the right and the left template include the ipsilateral testicular vein, from its origin to the profound inguinal orifice. Nerve sparing was at least carried out through a strict template dissection, preserving nerves outside template borders. If deemed possible, a nerve-sparing technique was also employed within templates for all patients. All surgeons had substantial experience in both open and robot-assisted RPLND. Surgery was performed in five tertiary hospitals in Norway and Sweden. The exclusion criteria were elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels, retroperitoneal mass exceeding 3 cm or more than two enlarged lymph nodes on FDG-PET/CT, previous RPLND, former radiotherapy to the abdomen or former chemotherapy other than one adjuvant course of BEP (administered within the SWENOTECA ABC-study  [16] ), or one course of carboplatin.

Of these patients, 33 (53%) had a relapse in CS I allocated to surveillance, six (10%) experienced a relapse in CS I following adjuvant chemotherapy, and 23 (37%) had primary metastatic disease CS IIA or B (see  Table 1 ). In 68% of the cohort, one single retroperitoneal lymph node was enlarged. The median time from orchiectomy to RPLND for patients initially classified as having CS I was 17 mo (IQR 14–50). Two patients received bilateral RPLND. One of these patients underwent bilateral approach due to a right-sided orchiectomy tumor and radiographic findings indicating involvement on the left side of the aorta. The other patient had unexpected intraoperative tumor findings in the abdominal region. The median blood loss was 100 ml (IQR 50–195), the median operating time was 139 min (IQR 110–195), and the median duration of hospitalization was 2 nights (IQR 2–6). Complications according to Clavien-Dindo III were observed in three patients (5%) within 30 d, but no grade IV or V complications occurred. Robot-assisted RPLND was performed in 65% of the cohort.

Metastatic seminoma was confirmed histologically in 58 patients (94%), two patients (3%) were pN0, one patient (2%) presented with a teratoma, and one patient presented with a nonseminoma other than teratoma (see  Table 2 ). Microscopic perinodal extension of tumor cells was observed in 18 patients (29%). Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 18 (29%) of the patients after RPLND, 17 of them receiving one course of BEP. One patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy on two occasions: a single course of carboplatin following orchiectomy in CS I and 5 yr later one course of BEP after RPLND.

In all, six patients have relapsed, and all were treated successfully. One patient initially classified as having CS IIB exhibited two large tumors measuring over 4 cm in the pathology report. The patient was evaluated to still harbor metastatic disease following RPLND and subsequently received three courses of BEP. However, shortly after completing chemotherapy, the patient experienced a new recurrence in the retroperitoneum, and thereafter received paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin in two cycles and subsequent high-dose chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide). Initially, this patient had a delay in orchiectomy due to personal choice, for 3½ yr from the onset of symptoms. Relapses occurred within the surgical treatment field in four patients (67%). No proportional differences were identified within the relapsing patients when stratifying for CS, surgical approach, or perinodal tumor growth. The only significant proportional difference observed among patients who experienced a relapse after surgery was a left-sided testicular tumor ( p  = 0.03), in addition to the absence of postoperative adjuvant treatment. At the last follow-up of August 2023, all patients with previous recurrence were disease free. Comprehensive outlines of relapses and surgical complications are presented in  Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 . PFS at 24 mo was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86–1) and OS was 100%. No significant differences in PFS were discovered when stratifying for CS. A subgroup analysis after surgery demonstrated 100% PFS for the adjuvant-treated group and 86% PFS for patients without adjuvant treatment (95% CI: 0.76–0.96) at 24 mo ( p  = 0.1; see  Fig. 2 ). The median time for follow-up for the 56 patients not experiencing a relapse was 24 mo (IQR 18–30). Fig. 2 Progression-free survival after RPLND stratified on postoperative adjuvant treatment.

        "content": "In addition to presenting the largest cohort to date, this is also the first report on outcomes for RPLND as the preferred treatment in low-volume seminoma at a population-based level. For CS IIA/B seminomas, radiotherapy has traditionally been the curative treatment option. However, this approach was abandoned in the SWENOTECA guidelines due to a high risk of relapse (10–19%)  [5] ,  [18] ,  [19] . For the past decade, the standard treatment for this group has been three courses of BEP or four courses of etoposide and cisplatin. The recurrence rate after first-line chemotherapy in CS IIA/B seminoma has been reported by SWENOTECA to be close to zero  [5] . The primary objective of the SWENOTECA X protocol is therefore prioritizing safety and reduction in treatment burden without compromising the survival outcomes. We found the rates of complications and surgical outcomes to be comparable with earlier reported findings in SEMS, PRIMETEST, and CO-TRIMS (see  Table 3 ). However, the recurrence rate was lower: 10% in SWENOTECA, as opposed to 22% in SEMS and 30% in PRIMETEST. When evaluating this finding, one must acknowledge that the time of follow-up is significantly shorter and therefore the rate of recurrence is highly likely to increase to the levels of our colleagues’ reported results. Addressing other variables credible to influence the recurrence rate, the SWENOTECA cohort enforces more restrictive size criteria than PRIMETEST and CO-TRIMS, and one may hypothesize that larger metastases could increase the risk of recurrence. Finally, 29% of the patients treated according to our protocol received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (most by one cycle of BEP), which has probably reduced the recurrence rate. The rate of postoperative adjuvant treatment given in SEMS was 2% (carboplatin), and zero in PRIMETEST and CO-TRIMS. None of the six patients with a postoperative relapse in our cohort received adjuvant treatment after RPLND. Other than an overweight for left-sided tumors, we were unable to identify patterns among the limited number of patients who experienced relapse. No associations could be established regarding the initial CS, perinodal extension, or surgical approach. Given that the cohort was established prior to the decision regarding adjuvant treatment, it is important to interpret the Kaplan-Meier analysis within this contextual framework. Table 3 Summary of outcomes in four cohorts of seminoma patients with limited retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy treated with primary RPLND, counts ( n ) and percentage (%) PRIMETEST SEMS CO-TRIMS SWENOTECA Cohort n  = 33 n  = 55 n  = 30 n  = 62 Inclusion Seminoma  CS IIA-B Mk- <5 cm Seminoma  CS IIA-B <3 cm Seminoma CS IIA-B Mk- <5 cm Seminoma CS IIA-B ≤3 cm, ≤2 nodes Median follow-up (mo) 32 33 22 23 Robot-assisted laparoscopic RPLND (%) 58 0 10 65 Clavien-Dindo ≥III (%) 12 2 13 5 pN0 (%) 9 16 10 3 Postop adjuvant chemotherapy (%) 0 2 0 29 Recurrence rate (%) 30 22 10 10 CS = clinical stage; RPLND = retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Summary of outcomes in four cohorts of seminoma patients with limited retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy treated with primary RPLND, counts ( n ) and percentage (%) CS = clinical stage; RPLND = retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Long-term complications, such as the rate of retrograde ejaculation, have not been reported in this article. A more focused study on long-term effects in RPLND patients is currently underway by SWENOTECA. The preoperative clinical staging of the group was largely coherent with the histopathological findings, with a predominance of corresponding CS IIA and a median tumor size of 18 mm. Eight patients (13%) exhibited postoperative retroperitoneal metastasis of ≥3 cm, but none exceeded 5 cm, which would correspond to CS IIC. The rate of benign lymph nodes (pN0) in this cohort was 3%. One of the two patients displayed necrosis and fibrosis in a retroperitoneal lymph node, suggesting the presence of a prior tumor. The other patient with a benign outcome exhibited an unexpected, undiagnosed primary syphilis infection—a relative rarity in the Scandinavian countries. Radiological findings in this patient revealed a lymph node enlargement mimicking a malignant spread of the previous seminoma in CS I. It is worth noting that all patients in Sweden considered for RPLND undergo evaluation through a national multidisciplinary tumor board attended by urologists and oncologists specialized in germ cell cancer. Similar multidisciplinary conferences are held at a tertiary center level for the Norwegian patients. We believe that this collaborative approach has contributed to the low incidence of benign postoperative outcomes. Moving forward, there are more potential strategies to refine the selection of candidates for surgery. One promising addition is the utilization of the novel biomarker miR-371a-3p, which has demonstrated remarkable performance in detecting germ cell cancer, particularly seminomas  [20] ,  [21] ,  [22] ,  [23] . Combining conventional and contemporary biomarkers with PET and expertise consensus can potentially enhance further the precision of selecting seminoma patients for RPLND. Although FDG-PET/CT was a recommended part of the decision procedure, it is still on an experimental level. We intend to provide a detailed report on the PET findings within this patient group at a later date. A ten-fold increased recurrence rate after surgery compared with conventional systemic therapy, as demonstrated by this report, should be regarded in the context of anticipated considerably fewer long-term sequelae and future risks for these young patients. Prolonged follow-up has not identified any negative consequences resulting from short adjuvant chemotherapy  [24] . However, it is important to acknowledge that the cohort’s size is insufficient for drawing any definitive conclusions. Nevertheless, the strengths of this analysis include a homogenous population-based binational cohort, with close coherence to guidelines, treatment centralized to tertiary centers, and no loss to follow-up. Since a metastatic GCT is a rare condition, difficulties collecting enough patients to achieve statistical power or even randomization are evident. The best available strategy seems to be combining findings from prospective trials such as the four discussed here, and continually enrolling patients in prospective cohorts executed by experienced and committed RPLND surgeons as part of a multidisciplinary team. Given these strategies, surgery holds the possibility of evolving into the gold-standard treatment for low-volume metastatic seminomatous GCTs."

        "content": "Surgical intervention in the form of RPLND as primary treatment is an option for selected low-stage seminomas with a limited burden of disease, showing fewer complications and low relapse rates. This option carries the potential to reduce long-term morbidity and treatment-related mortality in comparison with radiotherapy and multiple courses of chemotherapy. Our data demonstrated high oncological efficacy and low morbidity. The results are dependent on meticulous staging of patients and the RPLND procedure being performed by an experienced surgeon at a specialized center.

Methods: We analyzed data from the NCDB from 2010 to 2015 for patients with both primary testicular cancers and brain metastases who were treated with brain-directed radiation. We performed multivariable logistic and cox regressions to identify predictors of treatment type and overall survival respectively. Results: Most patients meeting the above criteria received whole brain radiation therapy as opposed to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Predictors of improved survival were age, private insurance coverage, receipt of chemotherapy, and receipt of SRS. The 5-year survival rate was highest for patients who received SRS. Conclusion: This study confirms significantly improved overall survival with the use of SRS.",

        "content": "This project focused on a retrospective review of the NCDB, which is exempt from IRB review due to the de-identified nature of the dataset. The NCDB dataset is sourced from over 1,500 facilities and accounts for over 72% of newly diagnosed cancers in the US each year [ 6 ]. We are required to state that the Commission on Cancer and the American College of Surgeons did not verify the analytic or statistical methodology used, nor are they responsible for the methodology and conclusions drawn from these data by the investigators. We queried the NCDB for patients diagnosed with cancer of testicular origin during the years 2004–2015 who also had at least one brain metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Of note, the NDCB did not record brain metastases until 2010, thus limiting our dataset to 2010–2015. We then further subdivided this group into those that did and did not receive brain-directed radiation. This was possible because the NCDB includes data on the anatomic target of radiation. We also captured data on delivery of chemotherapy, which in the NCDB, is simply coded as a ‘yes’ or ‘no’; there is no data on type of systemic therapy or number of cycles delivered. The overall selection process for this study is outlined in  Figure 1 . Radiotherapy treatments included whole brain radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery. Mets: Metastases; SRS: Stereotactic radiosurgery; WBRT: Whole brain radiation therapy; XRT: Radiotherapy. A variety of demographic and socioeconomic variables are included in the NCDB dataset and were incorporated into our analysis. All patients had their primary cancers diagnosed between 2010–2015. These cancers were characterized as being either seminoma or non-seminoma in origin according to ICD-O-3 histology codes [ 7 ]. The median age of the cohort was 28 years, and patients were grouped according to their age in relation to the median. Race was subcategorized as White, Black and other. Quantification of comorbidities used the Charlson/Deyo comorbidity index. Patients were distinguished as having extracranial disease if bone, lung or liver metastases were also present at time of primary cancer diagnosis. The presence of metastases at other sites is unknown because the NCDB only supplies data on the presence of bone, lung and liver metastases while providing no information on quantity or quality of the metastases. Patients' areas of residence were designated metro, urban, or rural based on population size and degree of urbanization data as outlined by the USDA economic research service. Patient distance from their treatment facility was also recorded as being above or below the average patient distance from a facility, 38.9 miles for this cohort. Insurance status was also included in the dataset. Patients were categorized as being uninsured, having private insurance, or having government insurance. Finally, patients were categorized as receiving whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), chemotherapy alone, or no treatment–however, dosage information was not incorporated into the data analysis. Groupings were based on treatment type received with the goal of being able to compare overall survival between groups and to identify significant predictors of treatment type. Grouping based on histologic subtype of primary cancer was not pursued due to the small sample size of individuals with seminomatous cancers compared with those with non-seminomatous ones, preventing a robust comparative analysis between groups based on histologic subtype. Data were analyzed using Medcalc Version 20.106 (Belgium), and baseline characteristics were tabulated. Multivariable logistic regression was performed using patient characteristic data to determine significant predictors of administration of SRS in comparison to WBRT. Cox regression was then performed using the same variables, in addition to treatment type, to produce hazard ratios predictive of death. Confidence intervals of 95% were reported, and a level of 0.05 was used as an indicator of statistical significance. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to show overall probability of survival over time, as well as differences in survival probability with respect to the treatment received."

        "content": "In total, 342 patients with brain metastases at diagnosis were identified as meeting the selection criteria above. Their baseline characteristics are shown in  Table 1 . The majority (329, 96%) of patients had primary cancers of non-seminoma origin. The median age was 28 years (range: 18–83 years). Forty percent (135) of the patients received brain directed radiation, most often in the form of WBRT (75% of brain directed radiation). The median time to radiation was 28.5 days (Range: 0–239 days). The median WBRT dose was 3000 cGy in 10 fractions (1800–5400 cGy) while the median SRS dose was 2400 cGy in 1 fraction (380–4890 cGy). In addition, 91% of patients were diagnosed with other extracranial metastatic diseases, and 89% of patients received systemic therapy in the form of chemotherapy. The multivariable logistic regression of baseline patient characteristics ( Table 1 ) showed that presence of extracranial disease was a significant predictor of receipt of SRS, meaning that patients with extracranial disease were significantly more likely to receive SRS than patients without extracranial disease ( Table 2 ). Multivariable Cox regression showed that significant predictors of improved survival include receipt of SRS and receipt of chemotherapy in comparison to receipt of only WBRT, as well as age greater than 28 years ( Table 3 ). The median survival rate of the patient cohort was 16 months, with a 1-year survival rate of 59% and a 5-year survival rate of 39% ( Figure 2 ). Patients who received WBRT saw a reduced 5-year survival rate when compared with those who received SRS or chemotherapy (25, 58 and 47% respectively). The median survival time for patients with seminomatous primary malignancies was 50.2 months, and those with non-seminomatous primary malignancies had a median survival time of 15.2 months. Recipients of WBRT, SRS and no treatment had a median survival time of 12.9 months, 97.0 months and 1.3 months, respectively ( Figure 3 ).

        "content": "We compared 1- and 5-year OSs of testicular cancer patients with brain metastases treated with chemotherapy, WBRT, and SRS to determine which treatment was most predictive of survival. As stated in our results, the incidence of brain metastases at the diagnosis of primary testicular cancer is quite low, evident in just 0.4% of patients in our study. This rarity underscores the importance of specialized care and insights for such patients. As expected, we found a significant survival benefit to receiving chemotherapy, WBRT, or SRS when compared with receiving no treatment at all. In addition, we showed a likely benefit to SRS when compared with WBRT as seen in terms of 5-year survival probability. However, this benefit may be attributable to the notion that recipients of SRS might have fewer lesions, less extracranial burden, and better performance status, resulting in better initial survival probabilities. These potentially confounding variables are unable to be explored further due to the limited amount of patient data recorded in the NCDB. In addition, only 40% of patients in the study were listed as having received brain directed radiation. This may be because the NCDB does not record “salvage” WBRT, so it is possible that recipients of salvage therapy were recorded as receiving no brain directed radiation at all despite receiving it after initial systemic therapy. This notion is perhaps supported by times in excess of 200 days for administration of radiation seen in the dataset. It is also possible that the data reflect real-world practice and that brain-directed radiation is less commonly used in patients with primary testicular cancer than in patients with other primary solid malignancies. The presence of extracranial disease at time of diagnosis of brain metastasis was a significant predictor for receipt of SRS ( Table 2 ), although the reason behind its predictive power remains unclear due to the NCDB's lack of specific data on each patient's unique brain metastasis profile. Predictors of improved survival were receipt of chemotherapy, receipt of SRS, and age over 28 years ( Figure 3 ). The difference in median survival time between patients with seminomatous and non-seminomatous brain metastases was an interesting finding. The difference may be due to the small sample size of seminomatous patients presenting with brain metastases at time of diagnosis, or that the brain metastases from non-seminoma primary cancers result in worse prognosis than seminomatous metastases to the brain. However, the NCDB does not supply information on size or number of metastases for each patient, so a comparative conclusion on the lethality of the two types of brain metastases cannot be drawn from the dataset. A few similar comparable retrospective studies have been conducted, all with much smaller sample sizes. One study examined eight patients who were identified as having intracerebral metastases as a result of primary testicular cancer [ 8 ]. The goal of the analysis was to better understand patient survival time after brain-directed radiation as precisely as possible. All patients received WBRT and witnessed a 12-month survival rate in the range 60–67%, depending on radiation dose and schedule, which varies slightly in comparison to the 56% survival rate in our cohort. This discrepancy is likely due to the small sample size used in the other study. We expanded on their analysis by determining the 12-month survival rate for patients receiving SRS as opposed to WBRT, which was 68% with an impressive median survival time of about 96 months. An older report summarized outcomes of patients with brain metastases at time of diagnosis with testicular cancer, which represented 41% of patients in that group [ 9 ]. This analysis, done at Hannover University Medical School, determined that patients who received either chemotherapy or radiotherapy saw poor long term survival rates, while those treated with a combination of the two saw better long-term survival. The team concluded that only around 25% of all patients with brain metastases from testicular cancer would be able to achieve long term survival when treated with both chemotherapy and brain-directed radiation. Their figure is far lower than observed in our retrospective analysis of patients treated with SRS (58%) but on par with the survival rate seen in patients treated with WBRT (25%). There are a few study limitations due to the retrospective nature of the NCDB. A significant selection bias may be present in terms of radiation treatment. The NCDB also does not specify the amount or size of brain metastases present at diagnosis, which would influence both delivered treatment type and eventual outcome. Nor does the NCDB indicate if any patients received surgical intervention for their brain metastases, which can potentially influence outcome. There is no information on the types of systemic agents used, or the number of cycles delivered, which would also impact survival. Furthermore, the NCDB also lacks information on detailed outcomes relevant to this study type that are important in treating patients with brain metastases, such as local failure, toxicity, salvage therapy, and distant brain failure [ 10 ]. With these limitations in mind, this project was meant to serve as an analysis of the incidence and trends in treatment for patients with brain metastases as a result of testicular primaries rather than as a comparison of multiple treatment techniques."

        "content": "Brain metastases resulting from primary testicular cancer, though rare, represent a unique subset of patients requiring specialized therapeutic considerations. This comprehensive study, leveraging the National Cancer Database, is the most extensive of its kind, shedding light on the current practices and potential survival outcomes related to treatment modalities for these patients. The results suggest a notable survival benefit in receiving either chemotherapy, WBRT, or SRS compared with no treatment, with SRS possibly offering superior outcomes to WBRT. In addition, the only clinically significant predictor of patients receiving Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) included the presence of extracranial disease at the time of diagnosis, making it apparent that the presence of distant metastases might impact therapeutic choices. This information can serve as a platform for further research, elucidating whether treatment approaches should be revised based on the full metastatic profile of the patient. Nevertheless, the presence of various confounding factors, largely due to the limitations inherent to the NCDB, may influence these findings. Important variables such as the size and quantity of brain metastases, exact therapeutic regimens, and specific patient profiles remain obscured. Thus, while this study provides essential insights into treatment patterns and their associated outcomes, further detailed and prospective studies are necessary to draw more definitive conclusions on the optimal treatment strategy for testicular cancer patients with brain metastases. Future studies might aim to consider these factors, focusing on individualized patient-centric approaches for this specific cancer subtype. Testicular cancers are rare, accounting for 1% of solid male cancers, with a 5-year survival rate surpassing 95%. Brain metastases from these cancers are even rarer and affect prognosis and treatment options. Common treatments for brain metastases from testicular primary cancers include surgical resection, whole brain radiation (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or combinations of these methods. There is no clear consensus on treatment due to the rarity of the condition and the lack of data. A study using the National Cancer Database (NCDB) sought to understand the frequency of brain metastases at the time of testicular cancer diagnosis and to compare the effectiveness of SRS and WBRT. The study identified 342 patients with brain metastases from a testicular primary cancer, the majority of which were non-seminoma cancers. Out of these, 40% received brain-directed radiation, most often in the form of WBRT. Results showed that patients receiving SRS had better 5-year survival probabilities than those treated with WBRT. Predictors of better survival were treatment with chemotherapy, treatment with SRS, and age above 28 years. This comprehensive analysis provided insights into treatment patterns and outcomes but is limited by the lack of detailed patient profiles, treatment regimens, and other variables."

    "title": "Cognitive Impairment in Long-Term Survivors of Testicular Cancer More Than 20 Years after Treatment",
    "abstract": "Simple Summary Impaired cognition can be a late effect after treatment in long-term testicular cancer survivors, negatively affecting their daily life. However, little data is available beyond 20 years post-treatment. We assessed cognitive impairment in very-long-term survivors after treatment. In this study, we enrolled testicular cancer survivors with a follow-up duration ≥ 20 years—and age-matched healthy controls. Cognitive testing included the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Letter Fluency Test, and Trail Making Test. We used fasting blood samples to assess the presence of hypogonadism and measured cardiovascular damage and aging parameters. We included 184 testicular cancer survivors (66 chemotherapy patients, 53 radiotherapy patients, and 65 orchiectomy only patients) and 70 healthy controls. The median follow-up was 26 years. Testicular cancer survivors performed worse on cognitive tests compared to controls. In univariate analysis, the presence of hypogonadism was associated with lower cognitive scores. Physicians and patients should be informed about timely cardiovascular risk management and testosterone supplementation therapy during follow-up to reduce the risk of cognitive impairment. Abstract Background: Impaired cognition can be a late effect after treatment in long-term testicular cancer (TC) survivors, negatively affecting their daily life. However, little data is available beyond 20 years post-treatment. We assessed cognitive impairment in very long-term TC survivors after CT or RT and compared the results with stage I TC survivors and controls. Methods: In this cross-sectional multicenter cohort study, we enrolled TC survivors (treated with orchiectomy followed by CT or RT or orchiectomy only)—with a follow-up duration ≥ 20 years—and age-matched healthy controls. Cognitive testing included the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Letter Fluency Test, Category Fluency Test, and Trail Making Test. We used fasting blood samples to assess the presence of hypogonadism and measured cardiovascular aging parameters, including carotid pulse wave velocity (c-PWV) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Results: We included 184 TC survivors (66 CT patients, 53 RT patients, and 65 orchiectomy-only patients) and 70 healthy controls. The median follow-up was 26 years (range: 20–42). TC survivors had a lower combined score of the cognitive tests (mean cumulative Z-score −0.85; 95% CI −1.39 to −0.33) compared to controls (mean 0.67; 95% CI −0.21 to 1.57,  p  < 0.01). In univariate analysis, the presence of hypogonadism (β −1.50,  p  < 0.01), high c-PWV (β −0.35,  p  = 0.09), and high AGEs (β −1.27,  p  = 0.02) were associated with lower cognitive scores, while only AGEs (β −1.17,  p  = 0.03) remained a significant predictor in multivariate analysis (Model R2 0.31,  p  < 0.01). Conclusions: Long-term TC survivors performed worse on cognitive tests compared to controls. Physicians and patients should be informed about timely cardiovascular risk management and testosterone supplementation therapy during follow-up to reduce the risk of cognitive impairment.

        "content": "Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common solid malignancy affecting males between the ages of 15 and 35 years [ 1 ]. Depending on the disease stage, TC is treated by either orchiectomy only or by orchiectomy followed by radiotherapy (RT) or platinum-based chemotherapy (CT). The TC prognosis is very good, even in cases of metastatic disease, with the 10-year survival rates reaching 80–90% [ 2 , 3 ]. This results in a still-growing number of TC survivors. However, adverse late treatment effects have been shown to result in increased morbidity from second cancers [ 4 ], cardiovascular disease (CVD) [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ], nephrotoxicity [ 10 , 11 ], neurotoxicity [ 12 ], pulmonary toxicity [ 13 ], and Raynaud’s phenomenon [ 14 , 15 ]. Reports on cognitive impairment as a treatment effect, however, have shown a heterogeneous picture [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ]. Several longitudinal studies reported an initial decline in cognitive function after treatment for TC with a return to baseline cognitive function after 12 months of follow-up [ 16 , 17 ]. Illustrating the diversity of the data, a cognitive assessment performed in TC survivors after a longer follow-up (2–7 years) reported 62.5% as cognitively impaired, exceeding the expected normative frequency of 25% [ 18 ]. Several other reports performed in long-term TC survivors with a median follow-up of 10–14 years confirm an increased long-term cognitive impairment in TC survivors treated with CT [ 19 , 20 ]. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the improvement in cognitive function after an initial decline following treatment is transient, and cognitive function may worsen again after longer follow-up [ 19 ]. The underlying mechanism of this worsening is still unclear but may be related to healthy tissue damage, such as vascular damage, induced directly by platinum-based CT or indirectly by increased CVD risk factors after CT [ 21 , 22 ]. TC survivors have a 1.6-fold higher risk of dying from CVD than the general population [ 23 ]. This vascular morbidity could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of increased cognitive impairment. In patients without a history of TC, vascular risk factors—such as higher fasting glucose and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol—and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are associated with a decline in cognitive function [ 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ]. In TC survivors, however, such associations with cognitive impairment have not been extensively studied. Additionally, little information is available on objective cognitive performance of very long-term TC survivors. Therefore, in comparison to age-matched controls, we assessed the presence of cognitive impairment in a large group of long-term (>20 years) TC survivors treated with orchiectomy only, or with orchiectomy followed by radiotherapy or platinum-based chemotherapy. We aimed to objectify long-term cognitive impairment in this group and identify treatment-associated factors related to the development of these late effects. This is relevant to survivorship care and can support rehabilitation programs for long-term TC survivors."

        "content": "We performed a multicenter, observational cross-sectional cohort study comprising three groups of TC survivors based on treatment modality and an age-matched control group. For the first TC group, we randomly selected 70 TC survivors from the institutional database who had previously been treated with both orchiectomy and CT (CT group) at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). For the second group, 57 age-matched patients who had been treated with orchiectomy and RT (RT group) at either the UMCG, the Isala Hospital, or the Radiotherapeutic Institute Friesland (RIF) were included. For the third group, 70 age-matched patients who had been treated with orchiectomy only were included. The inclusion criteria for the TC survivor groups were: <40 years of age at diagnosis, <70 years of age at inclusion in the current study, and treatment for TC more than 20 years ago. The CT group included TC patients with good or intermediate prognosis according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification Group [ 28 ]. Patients receiving RT or CT for any other indication were not eligible. Participants with an active psychiatric disorder were excluded. The age-matched male controls were recruited with flyers distributed around the UMCG, especially in the non-patient areas and in neighboring supermarkets. Controls were <70 years of age. Exclusion criteria were an active episode of depression or previous treatment with CT, RT, or hormone therapy for any type of cancer. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University Medical Center Groningen (METc 2015/197). Written informed consent was obtained for all participants. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Anthropometrics (weight, height, waist and hip circumference) and blood pressure were measured in a standardized manner. Fasting blood samples were used to assess the lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)), glucose and HbA1C levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), creatinine levels, and the presence of either primary or secondary hypogonadism. Biologically active testosterone was calculated according to the validated method published by Vermeulen and colleagues [ 29 ]. To improve the homogeneity of study methods and enable between-study comparisons, cognitive function was assessed according to the recommendations from the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force (ICCTF) [ 30 ]. We therefore performed an Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT)—including a delayed recall (DR)—[ 31 ], the Letter Fluency Test (LFT) [ 32 ], the Category Fluency Test (CFT), and the Trail Making Test (TMT) parts A and B [ 33 ]. A detailed description of these tests is provided in Supplementary Methods. All assessments were performed at the UMCG. Cognitive impairment was defined according to the recommendations from the ICCTF—with either one test score below −2.0 standard deviations (SD) from the normative mean or two test scores below −1.5 SDs from the normative mean [ 30 ]—taking into account the expected probability of cognitive impairment due to the use of multiple cognitive tests [ 34 ]. Normative means were derived from the Advanced Neuropsychological Diagnostics Infrastructure (ANDI), an online normative database created from control datasets [ 35 ], which provides robust control data. We assessed concurrent anxiety and depression complaints with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire [ 36 ] and perception of cognitive dysfunction in daily life with the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ) [ 37 ]. Vascular function and structure measurements were performed by specialized technicians at the vascular laboratory of the UMCG. Pulse wave velocity—an indicator of vascular stiffness—was measured over the carotid-femoral trajectory (cf-PWV) and locally at the carotid (c-PWV), while simultaneously measuring arm blood pressure (SphygmoCor). The carotid artery intima media thickness (c-IMT) was measured with the MYLABTMONE (Esaote; Genoa, Italy) ultrasound system. c-IMT was measured at the far wall of the carotid artery. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were estimated non-invasively using skin autofluorescence with the AGE reader [ 38 ]. Fasting blood samples were drawn to assess biochemical markers for vascular damage (von Willebrand factor), coagulation markers (i.e., FVIII, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen, and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)) and hs-CRP. Z-scores—derived from ANDI—were normally distributed, so we reported means and standard deviations (SD). Differences in Z-scores between study groups were tested with a Student’s  t -test for two groups or an ANOVA for comparison of more than two groups. When assessing presence of cognitive impairment, the probability of a false-positive result—due to multiple comparisons—was calculated according to the methodology published by Ingraham and Aiken [ 34 ]. Due to the use of six cognitive tests, the probability of scoring at least one test −2 SD from a normative mean is approximately 0.14. The probability of scoring at least two tests −1.5 SD from a normative mean is approximately 0.06; these frequencies should therefore be expected in any control group. Multivariate normative comparisons (MNC) were used to compare multiple cognitive tests simultaneously [ 39 ], with a cut-off  p -value of 0.05 indicating cognitive impairment. Multivariate regression analysis was performed on the cumulative Z-scores on cognitive function tests using a backwards stepwise method. Variables with a significant association on univariate analysis ( p  < 0.1) were included in the model. Variables included in univariate analysis were known or suspected cognitive denominators—such as age and anxiety or depressive symptoms—as well as cardiovascular parameters (cf-PWV, c-IMT, AGEs, c-PWV, vWF, FVIII, fibrinogen, PAI-1 antigen, and tPA), metabolic parameters (body mass index (BMI) and presence of metabolic syndrome) and endocrine parameters (testosterone levels and presence of hypogonadism). The data were analyzed with SPSS 23.0 (IBM-SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA)."

Patient demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics at follow-up are reported in  Table 1 . There were no significant differences between TC survivors and the controls in age, level of education, current rate of employment, smoking behavior, blood pressure, total cholesterol, serum glucose, HbA1c levels and score of depressive symptoms on the HADS questionnaire. TC survivors had higher BMI compared to the controls ( Table 1 ). Metabolic syndrome was more prevalent in TC survivors than in controls (OR 2.6 (95% CI, 1.3–5.1)). The total levels of testosterone were lower in TC survivors than in controls (median 12.8 nmol/L (range 2.9–35.8) vs. 15.5 nmol/L (range 7.2–53.8),  p  < 0.01). The RT group had a somewhat shorter duration of follow-up ( Table 1 ). The CT group experienced more anxiety symptoms measured by the HADS questionnaire than the RT or orchiectomy only groups (median 4 (range 0–15) vs. 2 (range 0–14) vs. 3 (range 0–14), respectively,  p  = 0.03). TC survivors scored worse than controls on the AVLT, the LF, and on both categories of the CFT ( Figure 2 ,  Table 2 ). There were no differences in mean Z-scores between treatment groups of TC survivors ( Table 2 ). With the exception of the AVLT DR, the CT group had the lowest scores on each test among TC survivors. Compared to the orchiectomy-only group, only the lower TMT-A scores in the CT group reached statistical significance in the post hoc analysis (mean Z-score 0.14 (95% CI: −0.07 to 0.37) vs. 0.51 (95% CI: 0.28 to 0.74),  p  = 0.03). All raw study scores are reported in  Supplementary Table S1 . Single test results more than 2 SD below average occurred as frequently in TC survivors—varying from 3% to 6% depending on the test—as in controls ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Median scores on the CFQ were similar between TC survivors and controls (median 28 points (range 5–54) vs. median 28 points (5–62),  p  = 0.78). All CFQ subscores per study group are reported in  Supplementary Table S3 . Regarding the mean sum of Z-scores (six different tests), TC survivors scored negative (mean −0.85; 95% CI −1.39 to −0.33) while controls scored positive (mean 0.67; 95% CI −0.21 to 1.57,  p  < 0.01). The sum of Z-scores was similar between the treatment modalities for TC ( Figure 3 ). Subjective cognitive complaints reported through the CFQ did not correlate with the sum of Z-scores on the objective cognitive functioning tests (Spearman Rho −0.09,  p  = 0.18). Cognitive impairment was found in 16% of TC survivors and in 10% of controls ( p  = 0.24). The expected frequency of impairment in any control group was 17%. Using the multivariate normative comparisons—thus taking into account correlations between different cognitive tests—six participants were classified as cognitively impaired; five were TC survivors (3%), and one was from the control group (1%). Based on univariate regression, TC-associated factors—such as having received chemotherapy, the presence of hypogonadism, and lower biologically available testosterone levels—were associated with worse cumulative Z-scores on cognitive tests. RT was not associated with poorer performance on cognitive function. Age, symptoms of anxiety or depression, von Willebrand factor, AGEs and c-PWV were included in the multiple regression analysis ( Table 3 ). In the multiple regression analysis on the sum of Z-scores of cognitive functioning tests including all participants, anxiety symptoms, a history of TC, levels of biologically available testosterone, and AGEs were independent factors (model R2 0.31,  p  < 0.01,  Table 3 ). Other factors that were derived from the univariate analysis—such as age, depressive symptoms, von Willebrand factor, presence of primary hypogonadism, c-PWV, and having received chemotherapy for TC—did not significantly contribute to the model."

The sum of Z-scores was similar between the treatment modalities for TC ( Figure 3 ). Subjective cognitive complaints reported through the CFQ did not correlate with the sum of Z-scores on the objective cognitive functioning tests (Spearman Rho −0.09,  p  = 0.18). Cognitive impairment was found in 16% of TC survivors and in 10% of controls ( p  = 0.24). The expected frequency of impairment in any control group was 17%. Using the multivariate normative comparisons—thus taking into account correlations between different cognitive tests—six participants were classified as cognitively impaired; five were TC survivors (3%), and one was from the control group (1%)."

RT was not associated with poorer performance on cognitive function. Age, symptoms of anxiety or depression, von Willebrand factor, AGEs and c-PWV were included in the multiple regression analysis ( Table 3 ). In the multiple regression analysis on the sum of Z-scores of cognitive functioning tests including all participants, anxiety symptoms, a history of TC, levels of biologically available testosterone, and AGEs were independent factors (model R2 0.31,  p  < 0.01,  Table 3 ). Other factors that were derived from the univariate analysis—such as age, depressive symptoms, von Willebrand factor, presence of primary hypogonadism, c-PWV, and having received chemotherapy for TC—did not significantly contribute to the model."

        "content": "In this study of long-term TC survivors, we focused on cognitive impairment after a median follow-up duration of 26 years by testing cognitive function and relating this to treatment modalities and potential causal factors, such as hypogonadism and cardiovascular risk factors. TC survivors—treated with either orchiectomy only or orchiectomy and radiotherapy or platinum-based chemotherapy—performed worse on cognitive tests compared to controls. In particular, they scored poorly on all language-oriented cognitive tests. This is in line with an epidemiological study of Swedish TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy ( N  = 960). It reported an increased incidence of long-term compromised language after a median follow-up of 11 years [ 40 ]. They also reported that CT-treated TC survivors were most affected. In our study, univariate analysis indicated that the administration of CT was the only predicting treatment modality for cognitive function. This effect disappeared in multivariate analysis, which was likely due to the small differences between all three treatment modalities. Treatment with chemotherapy has been hypothesized to cause cognitive impairment—the so-called ‘chemobrain’—and has been widely studied in short- and long-term survivors of various types of cancer. During CT treatment for TC, an initial decline of cognitive function is seen, followed by normalization of cognitive performance after 6 to 18 months post-treatment [ 17 , 41 ]. Studies in long-term CT-treated TC survivors with median follow-up durations of 11 to 14 years also reported compromised cognitive function [ 20 , 42 ]. CT is associated with greater cardiovascular risks and could consequently cause cognitive impairment through vascular damage [ 43 ]. Platinum remnants are known to circulate in plasma for more than 10 years after cisplatin treatment, which could be a causal factor for long-term cognitive decline [ 44 ]. However, the results in our study did not show that very long-term CT-treated TC survivors performed significantly worse on a cognitive test compared to other treatment modalities. It might be that cognitive dysfunction is not that severe among very-long term CT-treated TC survivors (>20 years) compared to survivors of other treatment modalities. TC survivors have an enhanced risk of developing early cardiovascular disease [ 45 ]. This “accelerated vascular aging” could be a factor in the decreased cognitive performance shown in our study. For example, c-PWV—a known marker for carotid stiffness—was associated with poorer cognitive function in univariate analysis. Previous studies showed a similar association between c-PWV and cognitive impairment [ 46 , 47 , 48 ], with data indicating that carotid stiffness is an early marker to identify a disturbance in the organization of the functional brain network, even before clinical vascular pathology occurs [ 48 ]. Moreover, the accumulation of AGEs—which are linked to cognitive impairment [ 25 , 26 , 27 ]—were also associated with poorer cognitive function in the current study and remained an independent predictor in multivariate analysis. This is in line with the “accelerated cognitive aging” reported in a prospective study of 920 community-dwelling elderly without life-threatening cancer diagnosis whose AGEs and cognitive function were periodically assessed for nine years. In these elderly, high levels of AGEs were associated with greater cognitive decline [ 27 ]. Since hypogonadism is associated with cognitive decline, several epidemiological studies have suggested an endocrine mechanism: the presence of low serum testosterone after treatment for TC [ 42 , 49 ]. Primary hypogonadism—either successfully compensated for by elevated LH (subclinical) or incompletely corrected—almost only occurred in our TC survivor cohort. In line with this, primary hypogonadism was associated with worse cognitive outcomes on univariate analysis. Although this association disappeared during multivariate analysis, biologically available testosterone levels remained associated with cognitive function. This is in line with our observation of cognitive decline across all treatment groups, since orchiectomy and primary hypogonadism was present to a certain extent in all TC survivors, irrespective of treatment modality. Thus, chronic hypogonadism might be an important underlying mechanism of cognitive impairment among very long-term TC survivors since both hypogonadism and cognitive impairment was seen in all three treatment modality groups. Although hypothesized that the CT-treated survivors would be at highest risk, this study does not support this hypothesis for very long-term TC survivors (>20 years post-treatment). Testosterone supplementation to treat cognitive impairment is an intervention possibility but has shown mixed results in previous studies. A double-blind trial randomized 308 healthy men without a history of TC, aged 60 and older with low or low-to-normal testosterone concentrations, to receive either testosterone ( n  = 156) or placebo ( n  = 152). No improvement in cognitive function was found [ 50 ]. However, other placebo-controlled trials that included hypogonadal men without a history of TC with both low serum testosterone and cognitive impairment did report beneficial effects from testosterone replacement therapy compared to placebo [ 51 , 52 ]. Therefore, to consider testosterone supplementation, it seems important to only treat patients with cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials to determine the effects of testosterone supplementation on complaints of hypogonadism are currently recruiting TC patients with low serum testosterone after treatment ( NCT02991209  and  NCT03339635 ). The results of these ongoing studies could clarify the potential benefits of testosterone supplementation on cognitive function in TC survivors. Both these mechanisms—endocrine and vascular—might also explain why our CT-treated cohort performed slightly worse (although not reaching significance) on the cognitive tests than the orchiectomy-only and RT-treated TC survivors, since CT-treated survivors are more prone to various endocrine and vascular sequelae. However, the number of TC survivors with cognitive impairment—using the suggested definition from the ICCTF—did not exceed the statistically expected proportion of 17%. This could partly be due to the use of discrete cut-off values for cognitive impairment, which prevents more nuanced assessment of the continuous spectrum of cognitive function. Bottom-line, it is a reassuring finding that cognitive dysfunction among TC survivors is not highly present and thus may not be a big issue in very long-time survivors. However, there may be an underestimation of cognitive dysfunction by a limitation in our study that our results could be influenced by selection bias because we had no data on cognitive dysfunction from deceased patients. They might have died earlier from treatment-related causes during follow-up, such as vascular damage, and this might contribute to the underestimation of the presence and burden of cognitive dysfunction in TC survivors. Future prospective studies within this area are needed to address to what extent cognitive impairment is present in TC survivors over time."

        "content": "Our study of a large cohort of TC survivors with uniquely long-term follow-up showed that TC survivors perform significantly worse than controls on a series of cognitive function tests. Although this effect size was clinically small, it was present in all treatment groups, especially the CT-treated patients. It is suggested that vascular and endocrine pathophysiological components underlie the long-term cognitive decline in TC survivors irrespective of their treatment. Timely cardiovascular risk management and testosterone supplementation therapy in selected TC survivors at high risk for late effects is relevant and may alleviate long-term cognitive decline. This needs to be further investigated."

    "abstract": "Purpose Clinical stage I (CSI) testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) represents disease confined to the testis without metastasis and CSIS is defined as persistently elevated tumor markers (TM) after orchiectomy, indicating subclinical metastatic disease. This study aims at assessing clinical characteristics and oncological outcome in CSIS. Methods Data from five tertiary referring centers in Germany were screened. We defined correct classification of CSIS according to EAU guidelines. TM levels, treatment and relapse-free survival were assessed and differences between predefined groups (chemotherapy, correct/incorrect CSIS) were analyzed with Fisher’s exact and Chi-square test. Results Out of 2616 TGCT patients, 43 (1.6%) were CSIS. Thereof, 27 were correctly classified (cCSIS, 1.03%) and 16 incorrectly classified (iCSIS). TMs that defined cCSIS were in 12 (44.4%), 10 (37%), 3 (11.1%) and 2 (7.4%) patients AFP, ß-HCG, AFP plus ß-HCG and LDH, respectively. In the cCSIS group, six patients were seminoma and 21 non-seminoma. Treatment consisted of active surveillance, carboplatin-mono AUC7 and BEP (bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin). No difference between cCSIS and iCSIS with respect to applied chemotherapy was found ( p  = 0.830). 5-year relapse-free survival was 88.9% and three patients (11%) in the cCSIS group relapsed. All underwent salvage treatment (3xBEP) with no documented death. Conclusion Around 1% of all TGCT were classified as cCSIS patients. Identification of cCSIS is of critical importance to avoid disease progression and relapses by adequate treatment. We report a high heterogeneity of treatment patterns, associated with excellent long-term survival irrespective of the initial treatment approach.",

        "content": "Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are among the most common solid tumors in men between the age of 15–35 [ 1 ,  2 ]. Correct clinical staging for TGCTs depends on the histologic subtype including pathohistology, radiographic evaluation of potential metastases as well as correct interpretation of serum tumor markers (TM) levels in the course of the disease [ 1 ]. 50–60% of patients initially present with increased levels of TMs (α-feto protein, AFP, β-human chorionic gonadotropin, β-HCG and lactate dehydrogenase, LDH). Clinical Stage I (CSI) is the most prevalent clinical stage in TGCT patients, which is defined as disease limited to the testis without any radiographic signs of metastases. However, there is a unique subgroup of patients in CSI with inadequately declining, persistently elevated or even increasing TMs after orchiectomy in the presence of negative cross-sectional imaging studies, which is characterized as clinical stage IS (CSIS). The clinical significance of this particular subgroup is little understood and the true prevalence is not well specified. Previous studies reported relative frequencies of < 5% of all TGCTs [ 3 ]. However, it must be assumed that a number of CSIS cases are incorrectly characterized due to misinterpretation of for example mildly elevated AFP [ 4 ,  5 ]. CSIS may occur in seminomas as well as in non-seminomas and all of the three classical tumor markers may be involved [ 6 ,  7 ]. Therefore, a wide variety of clinical features may occur in CSIs patients and little is known about the relative frequencies of the various clinical patterns and their therapeutic outcomes. The European Association of Urology Guidelines on testicular cancer recommend to treat CSIS using three cycles of BEP polychemotherapy (bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin) [ 1 ,  2 ]. However, as this standard chemotherapy may involve significant long-term toxicity and as most of the patients with early stage TGCT will survive, the optimal treatment modality for this rare subgroup of patients with only minimal disease burden still needs to be defined. In this study we aimed to analyze the true frequency of patients with CSIS in a large population of TGCT patients in respect to pre- and postoperative TM values. Furthermore, we aimed to analyze the number of patients falsely characterized as CSIS. The different treatments modalities that were applied to the patients were also analyzed and the respective therapeutic outcome was recorded."

In the present study, the reference limits of the participating institutions were employed to characterize CSIS patients. To ascertain correct diagnosis of CSIS, we collected and checked data on TM levels at the time of diagnosis before and after ablative surgery up to the nadir that allowed the authors to correctly interpret the appropriate TM development. CSIS was defined for each case individually in consensus of the main authors (MPB, FZ, PP). At least three consecutive TM values for all three TMs were used to ensure correct interpretation of half-life kinetics. If TMs increased after ablative surgery, no further value of the respective TM was mandated. Cases with sufficient data that did not meet the criteria of CSIS were classified as incorrect CSIS (iCSIS). Cases with missing or incomplete data that did not allow correct classification were excluded. In this retrospective multicenter analysis, we included five tertiary referring hospitals in cooperation with the German Society of Residents in Urology Academics (GESRU Academics Testis and Penile Cancer Group). TGCT patient charts from each study site were retrospectively screened for CSIS between 1999 and 2018. We registered the total number of TGCT cases as well as the number of CSIS cases. First, data from all patients with a documented clinical stage IS from a digital data file from each participating center were extracted for further analysis. In a second step, the extracted CSIS cases were analyzed for correct or incorrect clinical staging. In order to perform correct clinical staging and to further evaluate clinical data, we registered the following parameters: patient´s age, histology of primary tumor, type of TM (AFP, bHCG, or LDH), mode of postoperative TM kinetics (no timely marker decline, increasing, undulant), the primary treatment modalities, length of follow-up (months) for each patient as well as the treatment in case of relapse. The time point of cross sectional imaging in relation to the date of orchiectomy was also verified to ensure correct clinical staging. Disease free survival and overall survival was assessed until the last known visit in the respective urologic department. Approval of the local ethics committee of cologne was obtained (No. 18-008). All data were anonymously analyzed in accordance with the local ethical standards and the declaration of Helsinki. All data were tabulated with a commercial data base software and descriptively analyzed. Differences between the group of correct and incorrect CSIS in respect to application of chemotherapy and TM levels were calculated with Fisher-exact test or Chi-square test as appropriate.

BEP chemotherapy was applied in 20 cases (one cycle  n  = 1; two cycles  n  = 8,  n  = 11 with three cycles) and carboplatin AUC7 chemotherapy in two patients. One patient was recommended one cycle of carboplatin-mono AUC7 but did not receive the recommended therapy. In the incorrect CSIS group two patients were managed with surveillance, ten patients with BEP (one cycle  n  = 2, two cycles  n  = 3,  n  = 5 with three cycles) and three patients received carboplatin-mono AUC7. One patient received two cycles of PEI (cisplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide). The frequency of chemotherapy application was not different among the correctly and incorrectly classified cases with CSIS ( p  = 0.830). In the correctly classified CSIS group, relapse occurred in three cases (11%) after 7.8, 11 and 13.8 months one of whom initially underwent AS (non-seminoma) and two patients had initially received one cycle carboplatin-mono (both seminomas). TMs that defined CSIS in these patients were AFP for the first, β-HCG for the second and LDH for the third case of relapse. In all three cases of relapse, the classification according to IGCCCG was “good prognosis” and salvage treatment for all three patients was three cycles of BEP. In the total cCSIS cohort relapse-free survival after five and ten years was 88.9 and 77.8%, respectively (Fig.  2 ). No death was documented.

        "content": "Correct clinical staging for patients with CSI TGCT, especially CSIS, is a key factor to reduce sequelae of non-guideline-conform under- or overtreatment, resulting in potential loss in treatment efficacy on the one hand and excess treatment-associated morbidity on the other hand. The incidence of documented cCSIS disease in our study was 1% for the overall cohort of 27 patients, still being lower compared to 2–5% reported in the EAU Guidelines and another recent study [ 1 ,  3 ]. A prior population-based study evaluated the proportion of CSIS seminoma in the SEER database and found that 28% of all clinical stage I patients were staged as CSIS. Of these LDH and β-HCG were persistently elevated in 19 and 15% of stage I seminoma patients, respectively [ 8 ]. However, only 21% of these CS1 patients had their post-orchiectomy serum tumor markers properly recorded for a correct staging as CSIS. Consequently, the authors conclude, that the number of CSIS in their study might be overestimated [ 8 ]. In our patient population, in 37% of documented CSIS, TMs returned to normal after ablative surgery and consequently these patients were incorrectly classified as CSIS. One potential explanation for misclassified CSIS might be attributed to overhasty staging and the use of pre-operative TM for final classification. Inaccurate clinical staging due to misinterpretation of TMs has also been reported by Farber and collaborators who identified incorrectly documented TM levels in up to 71% of patients with testicular cancer [ 4 ]. As a result, adjusting for overall incidence with only the correct CSIS cases in our study, incidence of CSIS was at approximately 1%. On the other hand, this approximation is limited by a possible underestimation due to correct CSIS cases that were not identified and included in our analysis due to the absence of postoperative tumor marker determinations. These circumstances highlight the urgent need to emphasize the correct classification of the TCGT patients with a focus on the correct evaluation of tumor markers according to their expected half-life kinetics after ablative surgery. Although, guidelines recommend the use of all three tumor markers AFP, ß-HCG and LDH, they should be used with caution due to their partly non-specificity for testicular cancer. LDH, being the most unspecific TM, was found not to be a useful marker for relapse in patients on surveillance for CSI [ 9 ]. LDH can be elevated in various conditions like liver or kidney disease, myocardial infarction, hemolysis or strong exercise [ 10 – 12 ]. In our study, we observed two patients with elevated LDH that resulted in CSIS staging with one patient experiencing relapse. However, this finding might be due to the low case number and the retrospective design of this study. In a recent study, LDH remained elevated in 30.5–34.1%, but in concordance with our results, the colleagues point out the low specificity of LDH and state that its usefulness in clinical management is debatable [ 13 ]. On the contrary, recent data suggest that the serum level of LDH might just as well be a “new” prognostic marker in seminoma and non-seminoma according to preliminary data of the recently reported new IGCCCG-update program. Still, using LDH alone to classify a patient as CSIS might be too unspecific and must be interpreted carefully in the context of the patients’ clinical situation. According to the current IGCCCG risk classification, it is recommended, to use all three TMs LDH, AFP and ß-HCG, determining the prognosis and therapy outcome of patients with TGCT [ 1 ,  13 ]. In our cCSIS group, patients with increasing TM values or no timely marker decline received BEP in the majority of cases (89 and 83%, respectively) which can be considered a reasonable choice in order to achieve long term relapse free survival. On the contrary, the group with undulant AFP values, 33% of patients received BEP potentially indicating overtreatment for these patients. In another recent analysis, Wymer and coworkers evaluated the treatment pattern of 10 patients with AFP levels above normal and below 30 ng/ml, which persisted for at least 6 months without any further clinical or radiographic evidence metastasis [ 5 ]. Three of these patients received chemotherapy or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) based on their elevated AFP (9, 15.8 and 8.6 ng/ml), however post-treatment AFP was unchanged. Consequently, the colleagues recommend surveillance for CSIS patients with only mildly elevated and stable AFP to reduce unnecessary treatment morbidity. In our study, undulant AFP values were present in 6 patients and did not exceed 20 ng/ml. Thereof, 4 patients were treated with AS resulting in one reported relapse after 7.8 months. The remaining two patients did not experience relapse. In a recent case series with five seminoma patients and elevated AFP-values also below 20 ng/ml, AFP remained unchanged after chemotherapy treatment [ 14 ]. As a result, our data support the need of correct TM interpretation after ablative surgery, keeping in mind that AFP might be elevated due to other pre-existing medical conditions [ 5 ,  15 ]. Considering the drawbacks with standard TMs in clinical routine, ongoing trials are evaluating novel TMs such as the mRNA371-a-3p which showed promising results with higher sensitivity and specificity for patients experiencing relapse compared to AFP, ß-HCG and LDH [ 16 ]. Noteworthy, the TM that defined CSIS for one patient who was treated with AS had an undulant AFP value and the other patients who received carboplatin-mono AUC7 had no timely marker decline of ß-HCG and a TM increase (LDH). Overall, three patients (11%) in the correctly classified CSIS group experienced relapse of which two were seminomas and one was non-seminoma. One patient was initially treated with AS and two patients received carboplatin-mono AUC7. Salvage treatment in our study resulted in 100% cancer specific survival which is in line with the excellent cure rates reported for CS I TGCT disease [ 17 ]. In contrast to this, no relapse occurred in the BEP treated population. Treatment patterns in our study were highly heterogeneous for CSIS patients consisting of AS, different cycles of BEP and lastly carboplatin-mono AUC7 which underlines the complexity of CSIS for treating physicians. The ideal treatment for correct CSIS is still matter of debate and to best of our knowledge there is no data available that compared the effectiveness of different treatment patterns for CSIS such as surveillance, carboplatin mono, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, three cycles of BEP chemotherapy is possibly the most established treatment. Interestingly, we found no difference in the relapse rate between 2 × BEP and 3 × BEP treated CSIS patients within our cohort. This might generate the hypothesis, that a lower number of PEB cycles might be sufficient to cure CSIS patients, similarly to the situation in CSI non-seminoma [ 18 ]. As our case numbers are quite low (2 × BEP:  n  = 8; 3 × BEP:  n  = 11), this remains largely hypothetical and should not be considered as standard clinical practice. Surveillance is not regarded as a treatment option in CSIS patients according to EAU guidelines so far but has been added to the NCCN guidelines for CSIS seminoma patients [ 1 ,  19 ]. In line with NCCN guidelines, our data support surveillance since three out of four patients in the AS cohort did not experience relapse of which all three patients were seminomas. However, these patients were all documented as CSIS in their patient files and according to our methodology were classified as cCSIS. These cases are potentially those that would need critical discrimination whether the AFP value is elevated due to occult disease or other benign reasons. In the latter case, these patients should not have been categorized as CSIS in their patient records. Conversely, treatment with one cycle of carboplatin-mono AUC7 was not very effective and resulted in two subsequent relapses in which TMs increased or had no timely marker decline. In consequence, our data support the hypothesis that surveillance might be the adequate treatment of choice for seminoma CSIS patients with mildly elevated AFP since 75% of patients with undulant AFP values did not experience relapse and had most likely elevated AFP due to other non-malignant reasons (Table  1 ). Prior studies not only emphasize the potential presence of retroperitoneal disease in CSIS but also of occult metastasis, leading to the recommendation of thee cycles of BEP [ 20 ,  21 ]. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy leads to a high cure rate in CSIS patients with a 5 and 10-year disease-free survival rates of 87 and 85%, respectively [ 22 ]. In our study, the 5- and 10-year relapse free survival was 88.9 and 77.8%, respectively. Despite missing prospective data in CSIS, the oncologic outcome of RPLND is currently evaluated in prospective trials for CSI seminoma ( NCT02797626 ,  NCT02537548 ) and is considered an option in selected high risk seminoma that should be discussed as an option with the patient [ 1 ]. Radiotherapy on the other hand should not be applied in CSIS according to the current guideline recommendations. This is in line with the results of our study, as no patient was treated with radiotherapy. Additionally, a prior SEER database analysis found a decreasing number of CSIS seminoma patients treated with radiotherapy [ 8 ]. Regarding the histopathological subtype, Kamran and co-workers showed that adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy for seminoma decreased over time but remained stable for non-seminoma CSIS patients who received chemotherapy or RPLND potentially indicating an increasing awareness of a risk-adapted therapy approach [ 3 ]. Our study results are hampered by a few limitations. Due to the retrospective nature of this analysis, we were unable to determine the percentage of CSI patients that received postoperative TM determinations to a sufficient extent, possibly leading to a misinterpretation of TM dynamics and underestimation of the prevalence of cCSIS patients in our cohort. Second, we did not evaluate histopathological risk factors within the overall CSIS population, for example, tumor diameter, rete testis invasion or lymphovascular invasion. In CSI seminoma and non-seminoma patients with high risk for occult disease, adjuvant treatment is a standard of care recommendation and effective in reducing the risk of relapse [ 1 ,  23 ,  24 ]. Consequently, in these cases the application of chemotherapy in CSIS is justified and should not be considered as overtreatment. In addition, radiographic disease extent was based on the respective radiological reports and we did not re-evaluate the CT or MRI scans in patients with correctly classified CSIS for reasons of availability. It might be possible that re-evaluation would have revealed lymph node involvement just above 1 cm which would in turn lead to staging as CSIIA. Finally, the median follow-up of 24.5 months is relatively short and should be considered with caution when interpreting this data."

        "content": "CSIS is a rare clinical situation that affected around 1% of all TGCT cases in our large patient cohort. Our study revealed incorrect classification of CSIS in around one third of these documented CSIS cases. Meticulous review of adequate post-operative TM decline, with particular caution in undulant TM course, is mandatory to identify correct CSIS, define the appropriate treatment strategy and avoid potential overtreatment in false-positive CSIS cases. BEP chemotherapy was the most common treatment applied to CSIS patients, resulting in a 100% relapse-free survival, irrespective of the number of applied chemotherapy cycles. Relapse-free survival was relatively high within our CSIS cohort and relapses were effectively treated with BEP chemotherapy. This may lead to the assumption, that not all patients with cCSIS may benefit from immediate BEP chemotherapy, especially when TM are rather slightly elevated and show no clear dynamics."

    "abstract": "Purpose Dual inhibition of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) may be a potential strategy to improve antitumor efficacy in testicular cancer. Methods A combined virtual screening protocol including pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking was used for screening potent dual-target ATM/HDAC2 inhibitors. In order to obtain the optimal lead compound, the dual ATM/HDAC2 inhibitory activity of the screened compounds was further evaluated using enzyme inhibition methods. The binding stability of the optimal compound to the dual targets was verified by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. MTT assay and in vivo antitumor experiment were performed to validate antitumor efficacy of the optimal compound in testicular cancer. Results Here, we successfully discovered six potent dual-target ATM/HDAC2 inhibitors (AMHs 1–6), which exhibited good inhibitory activity against both ATM and HDAC2. Among them, AMH-4 showed strong inhibitory activity against both ATM (IC 50  = 1.12 ± 0.03 nM) and HDAC2 (IC 50  = 3.04 ± 0.08 nM). MD simulation indicated that AMH-4 binds to ATM and HDAC2 with satisfactory stability. Importantly, AMH-4 had significant antiproliferative activity on human testicular tumor cells, especially NTERA-2 cL.D1 cells, and no inhibitory effect on normal human testicular cells. In vivo experiments exhibited that AMH-4 was more effective than lartesertib and vorinostat in inhibiting the growth of NTERA-2 cL.D1 xenograft tumors with low toxicity. Conclusion Overall, these results suggest that AMH-4 is an effective and low toxicity candidate for the treatment of testicular germ cell tumors.",

        "content": "Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most common type of testicular malignancy, emerging most frequently in males between the ages of 15 and 40. 1 , 2  During the past 20 years, the incidence of testicular cancer has continued to rise in many countries and is expected to increase further in the future. 3 , 4  Currently, surgery and standard-dose chemotherapy are the main methods of treating TGCT. 5  Approximately 80–90% of metastatic TGCT have a high cure rate after standard dose cisplatin chemotherapy. 5  However, testicular cancer survivors treated with cisplatin face many toxic side effects, including ototoxicity, neuropathy, cardiovascular toxicity, infertility, and secondary malignancies. 6  In addition, young patients may face a range of long-term psychosocial issues after treatment, including mental health, gender relations and work issues, which can significantly affect their overall quality of life. 7  For TGCT-resistant patients who have failed multiple chemotherapy regimens, the clinical cure rate is extremely low. 6  Therefore, the development of novel drugs for testicular cancer is indeed urgent. At present, dual-target therapy is a promising treatment strategy with fewer side effects, lower toxicity, and the potential to overcome drug resistance in cancer treatment. 8–10 ATM plays a central role in protecting the genome from DNA damage through intact DNA repair pathways. 11–13  There are growing evidences suggest that ATM can coordinate homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and maintain genomic integrity. 11 , 14 , 15  In response to DSBs, ATM kinase undergoes self-phosphorylation and subsequently phosphorylates several downstream substrates, including p53, p21, Nbs1, and KAP1, ultimately mediating DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. 12 , 16 , 17  Studies have shown that abnormal ATM, characterized by serine 1981 phosphorylation, can be observed in testicular germ cell tumors. 18  Therefore, the inhibition of ATM represents a potential therapeutic strategy in testicular cancer treatment. Despite recent advances in ATM inhibitors, such as lartesertib, 19  AZD1390, 20  and KU60019 21  ( Figure 1 ), toxicity and drug resistance cannot be ignored. There are currently no ATM inhibitors specifically for testicular cancer. Thus, it is urgent to develop novel ATM inhibitors with good drug properties and few side effects.\n Figure 1 Reported ATM and HDAC inhibitors. Reported ATM and HDAC inhibitors. HDAC2, a member of the HDAC family, has been shown to be closely associated with tumor proliferation. 22–24  Overexpression of HDAC2 can increase deacetylation and cause an imbalance in the expression of certain cell cycle regulators, leading to cancer initiation and progression. 25–27  HDAC2 regulates the expression of a variety of genes and promotes cancer progression by silencing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (such as NOXA and APAF1) and inactivating the tumor suppressor p53. 28 , 29  In several types of cancer, high levels of HDAC2 expression are closely associated with tumor development, and may contribute to the development of resistance to cancer therapies. 30  Thus, HDAC2 is considered to be a potential target for cancer therapy because of its role in tumorigenesis. 31  Currently, some HDAC inhibitors are already used in clinical cancer treatment, including vorinostat, romidepsin, and belinostat ( Figure 1 ). 32–34  However, most of these drugs are pan HDAC inhibitors and have similar dose-limiting toxicity. 35 , 36  So the development of specific HDAC2 inhibitors is particularly important. A recent study has shown that the combination of the ATM inhibitor KU60019 and the HDAC inhibitor romidepsin produces more effective cytotoxic effects in lymphoma cell lines than either drug alone. 37  Moreover, clinical studies have shown that HDAC inhibitors can reduce ATM-mediated activation of DNA damage signaling in a variety of tumor cells. 38  Thus, the combination of HDAC inhibitors and ATM inhibitors may synergistically cause insufficient DDR induction in tumor cells to enhance antitumor activity. 38  Although the combination of two drugs shows favourable therapeutic effects, the different drugs result in non-overlapping resistance mechanisms and different toxicities. 39 , 40  Compared to combination therapies, dual-target drugs with a single chemical entity may reduce the risk of drug-drug interactions, decrease toxicity and improve patient compliance. 39 , 40  Thus, dual-target ATM/HDAC2 inhibitors are potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of testicular cancer. To date, there are no reports of dual-target ATM/HDAC2 inhibitors. Structure-based virtual screening is a computational approach to discovery lead compounds that is more cost-effective than traditional high-throughput screening. 41  The combined screening of the pharmacophore models and molecular docking can effectively identify potential drug candidates against specific targets. 42 , 43  In previous studies, we have successfully discovered some new and potent dual-target inhibitors through a comprehensive virtual screening scheme: PLK1/PLK4, NRP1/KRAS G12D , tubulin/PARP-1. 9 , 41 , 44  Here, we identified novel dual-target ATM/HDAC2 inhibitors (AMHs 1–6) through a combined virtual screening protocol. Among them, AMH-4 had the highest inhibitory activity on both ATM and HDAC2. Meanwhile, AMH-4 showed significant in vitro antiproliferative and in vivo antitumor activity in testicular cancer with low toxicity. In conclusion, the dual-targeted ATM/HDAC2 inhibitor AMH-4 is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of testicular cancer."

        "content": "The human testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) cell lines (NTERA-2 cL.D1, Cates-1B, Tera-1) and human normal testicular cell line (Hs 1.Tes) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were cultured with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin. The cell culture system was maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . Hit compounds (AMHs 1–6) were purchased from WuXi AppTec (Shanghai, China), the vendor name and ID of AMHs 1–6 are listed in  Table S1 . Recombinant human ATM and HDAC2 proteins were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). The crystal structures of ATM (PDB ID: 7NI4) and HDAC2 (PDB ID: 4LXZ) proteins were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The two crystal structures were imported into the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE, Chemical Computing Group Inc, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The QuickPrep tool of MOE was used for structural preparation, including the deletion of distant solvent and the addition of hydrogen atoms. Then, the energy was minimized through Amber14: EHT force field. Based on combinatorial chemistry methods, we have established a database of 43,000 compounds. The Ligand interactions tool in MOE was used to construct pharmacophore models based on the ATM crystal structure, including hydrogen bond donor, hydrogen bond acceptor, aromatic center and hydrophobic centroid. The established pharmacophore model was then used for virtual screening to determine the screening results in terms of root mean square deviation (RMSD) values. Next, the selected compounds were further subjected to molecular docking based on the above crystal structures of ATM and HDAC2. The ligand atoms were used to define active sites within the 5 Å region, and the docking was determined using the Triangle Matcher method and London dG scoring algorithm. Typically, lower docking scores reflect higher binding affinity. The inhibition assay was conducted according to previously reported methods. 45  First, ATM enzyme was mixed with Hepes buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl 2 , 1 mm DTT, 5% v/v Glycerol, 0.05% v/v Tween 20). The mixture was incubated with DMSO-dissolved compounds for 0.5 h. After the addition of a substrate solution of p53 (5 µM) and ATP (50 nM) for 2 h, the reaction was terminated by the addition of detection reagent (33 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1 M KF, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 13 nM D2 Anti-GST antibody (Cisbio) and 0.5 nM Eu 3+  Anti-p53phosphoS15 antibody). Finally, the values were obtained on the PHERAstar instrument (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC) with the standard Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) filter block method. IC 50  values were determined using the data analysis software Genedatascreener ® . The method was performed as described previously. 46  In brief, a mixture of 10 μL HDAC2 enzyme solutions and 50 μL mixed with various concentrations of inhibitor compounds was added to a 96-well plate and incubated for 5 min at 37 ° C. Next, the fluorescent substrate Boc-Lys (acetyl) -AMC (40 μL) was injected into each well and incubated for 0.5 h. The mixture was maintained for 20 min with 100 μL of developer containing trypsin and TSA. Finally, the fluorescence intensity at wavelengths of 390 and 460 nm was measured by a microplate reader (BioTek Cytation 5; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The structures of ATM (PDB ID: 7NI4) and HDAC2 (PDB ID: 4LXZ) were downloaded from the PDB. MD simulation was performed using GROMACS (version 2021.5) with the AMBER99SB ILDN force field. AMH-4 was imported into the Acpype Server ( www.bio2byte.be ) to obtain topology parameter files under the GAFF force field. Firstly, the system was dissolved in a 1.0 nm cubic box using SPC/E water models. Then, the sodium ions (Na + ) and chloride ions (Cl − ) were added to the system to maintain a neutral charge state. Subsequently, a 5000 step steepest descent algorithm was used for energy minimization. A V-type thermostat was used for 100 ps NVT balance to maintain system temperature at 300 K, and a 100 ps NPT simulation was performed by Parrinello Rahman barometer for further to maintain system pressure at 1 bar. Finally, a 50 ns MD simulation was conducted on the system and trajectory data was recorded at intervals of 10 ps. These data were processed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. The MTT assay was performed as previously described. 9  In this experiment, four types of cells were measured (NTERA-2 cL.D1, Cats-1B, Tera-1, and Hs1.Tes). The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5×10 4  cells/well and cultured overnight, respectively. Then AMH-4 at the various concentrations was added to each well and incubated at 37 ° C for 72 hours. Subsequently, the culture medium was removed and MTT solution (5mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated for another 4 hours. Then the supernatant was discarded and insoluble crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Finally, a microplate reader was used to detect absorbance at 570 nm. The dose-response curve was drawn using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) to determine the value of the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ). Male nu/nu mice (4–6 weeks old) were purchased from Changzhou Cavens Experimental Animal Limited Company (Changzhou, China). Mice were injected subcutaneously with NTERA-2 cL.D1 human testicular tumor cells suspended in PBS (200 µL, 1×10 7  cells). The tumors of 90–120mm 3  were generated in the bodies of the mice. The mice were randomly divided into four groups and daily intraperitoneal injection with vehicle, lartesertib, vorinostat and AMH-4, all at a concentration of 10 mg/kg. Tumor volume and body weight were measured every 3 days for 15 days. The tumor volume was measured directly using vernier calipers and calculated according to the formula: (c × c × d)/2 (c, minimum diameter; d, maximum diameter). All animal experiments used in this experiment have been approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of China Pharmaceutical University (permit number: 2023–03-018)."

The established pharmacophore model was then used for virtual screening to determine the screening results in terms of root mean square deviation (RMSD) values. Next, the selected compounds were further subjected to molecular docking based on the above crystal structures of ATM and HDAC2. The ligand atoms were used to define active sites within the 5 Å region, and the docking was determined using the Triangle Matcher method and London dG scoring algorithm.

        "content": "The pharmacophore models were constructed based on the crystal structure of ATM (PDB ID: 7NI4) to identify novel dual-target ATM/HDAC2 inhibitors. The Pharmacophore Query Editor of MOE was used to generate the most representative pharmacophore models. As shown in  Figure 2A , the generated pharmacophore models were composed of two Acc features (F1 and F2: hydrogen-bond acceptors) and two Aro features (F3 and F4: aromatics center). All of these features represented interaction points for ligand binding to ATM: (i) the F1 and F2 features formed hydrogen-bond interactions with the key amino acid residues Lys2717 and Cys2770; (ii) the F3 and F4 features formed hydrophobic interactions with hydrophobic residues, including Pro2699, Leu2715, Leu2722, Tyr2755, Leu2767, Trp2769, Ile2888. Therefore, the constructed pharmacophore models can be considered as key chemical features to discover new ATM/HDAC2 inhibitors.\n Figure 2 ( A ) The pharmacophore models based on the ATM structure.

( B ) The workflow of multi-step virtual screening of dual ATM/HDAC2 inhibitors. In this study, a multi-step virtual screening process was used to identify potential dual-targeted ATM/HDAC2 inhibitors from an in-house database. The multi-step virtual screening workflow is shown in  Figure 2B . Firstly, a two-dimensional (2D) database of 43,000 compounds was converted to a 3D structure. The constructed ATM pharmacophore models were used to screen the 3D database, resulting in the identification of 147 hit compounds with RMSD values less than 0.05 Å. Subsequently, these 147 screened hits were further docked to the active sites of ATM and HDAC2 to predict the binding affinities. The previously reported ATM inhibitor lartesertib and HDAC2 inhibitor vorinostat with a docking score of −12 kcal/mol were used as positive controls for the cutoff value. As shown in  Figure 3 , the docking values of six hits (AMHs 1–6) were less than −12 kcal/mol. Notably, AMH-4 had the lowest docking score of the six selected compounds, suggesting that it docked best with the active site of ATM/HDAC2. Based on the results of the above virtual screen, we further analyzed the interaction of six hit compounds with ATM/HDAC2. The chemical structures of the AMHs 1–6 are shown in  Figure 4 .\n Figure 3 The binding free energy (kcal/mol) of six selected hit compounds (AMHs 1–6). \n Figure 4 The chemical structures of six selected hit compounds (AMHs 1–6).

The possible binding modes of the six selected hits (AMHs 1–6) at ATM and HDAC2 active sites were analyzed ( Figures 5  and  6 ).  Figure 5  shows the interaction analysis between AMHs 1–6 and ATM, respectively. We found that the pyridine and quinoxaline groups in the AMHs 1–6 formed hydrogen bonding interactions with key amino acid residues Lys2717 and Cys2770, while the benzene ring and alkyl group had hydrophobic interactions with Pro2699, Leu2715, Leu2722, Tyr2755, Leu2767, Trp2769, and Ile2888 in the hydrophobic cavity.  Figure 6  shows the interaction analysis between AMHs 1–6 and HDAC2, respectively. The terminal N-hydroxyformamide group of AMHs 1–6 created an ionic bond with zinc ions in HDAC2 active sites. It is reported that the interaction between ligands and Zn 2+  is crucial for enhancing the inhibitory activity of ligands against HDAC. 47  In particular, the N-hydroxyformamide group in each compound had three hydrogen bonds with His145, His146 and Tyr308, the urea group created hydrogen bonds with Lys205, while amino acid residues Tyr209 and Leu276 formed intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, the benzene ring and alkyl group had hydrophobic interactions with Phe155 and Phe210. Based on the above interaction analysis, we further investigated the biological activities of AMHs 1–6.\n Figure 5 The binding modes of AMHs 1–6 (correspond to  A - F  respectively) in the active site of ATM.

Residues in the active site are shown as white. AMHs 1–6 are coloured in green. The hydrogen bonds are represented in black dashed lines. To evaluate the inhibitory effects of AMHs 1–6 on both ATM and HDAC2, the enzyme inhibition experiments were conducted. The ATM inhibitor lartesertib and HDAC2 inhibitor vorinostat served as positive controls. As shown in  Table 1 , we found that lartesertib had inhibitory activity on ATM (IC 50  = 17.22 ± 3.39 nM), and no inhibitory effect on HDAC2. In contrast, vorinostat had inhibitory activity on HDAC2 (IC 50  = 10.16 ± 2.75 nM), but did not affect ATM. AMHs 1–6 showed dual inhibition of both ATM and HDAC2, and the IC 50  values of the six compounds were all lower than the positive controls. This indicated that AMH 1–6 had significant inhibitory activity against ATM and HDAC2. The IC 50  values for inhibition of ATM by AMH 1–6 ranged from 1.12 nM to 9.68 nM, and those for inhibition of HDAC2 ranged from 3.04 nM to 9.27 nM. Notably, AMH-4 had the most potent inhibitory activity against both ATM (IC 50  = 1.12 ± 0.03 nM) and HDAC2 (IC 50  = 3.04 ± 0.08 nM), which was approximately 15-fold better than that of lartesertib (IC 50  = 17.22 ± 3.39 nM), and about 3-fold better than that of vorinostat (IC 50  = 10.16 ± 2.75 nM). The IC 50  determination curves showed that AMH-4 significantly inhibited the activities of ATM and HDAC2 ( Figure S1 ). In addition, AMH-4 exhibited the highest inhibitory activity, which was consistent with the docking score results. Therefore, AMH-4 is the most potent inhibitor for further in vitro cell viability evaluation.

The value of RMSD was calculated for the complex structure relative to the initial optimized structure. In  Figure 7A  and  B , The RMSD of the ATM-AMH-4 complex initially increased and remained stable at around 0.35 nm after 30 ns; the RMSD of the HDAC2-AMH-4 complex remained steady at around 0.2 nm after 10 ns, indicating that AMH-4 can bind stably to ATM and HDAC2. In addition, to assess the flexibility of the amino acid residues in the complex, the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values were also calculated ( Figure 7C  and  D ). As shown in  Figure 7C , the RMSF values of the key residues Pro2699, Leu2715, Lys2717, Leu2722, Tyr2755, Leu2767, Trp2769, Cys2770, and Ile2888 in the ATM active sites were all less than 0.2 nm throughout the simulation process, indicating that these key residues were stable in binding to AMH-4. In  Figure 7D , the RMSF values of key residues His145, His146, Phe155, Lys205, Tyr209, Phe210, Leu276, and Tyr308 in the HDAC2 active site show small fluctuations in intensity less than 0.1 nm, reflecting a strong interaction with AMH-4. Finally, the stability of the system was evaluated by analysing the changes in the secondary structure of the protein during the 50 ns MD simulation process. As shown in  Figure 7E  and  F , no significant changes were observed in the secondary structure of the protein, indicating the structural stability of ATM and HDAC2 in the complex. In conclusion, AMH-4 can stably bind to the active sites of ATM and HDAC2.\n Figure 7 MD simulation of AMH-4 in complex with ATM and HDAC2. ( A ) The backbone RMSD of the complex of ATM and AMH-4.

To evaluate in vitro antiproliferative activity of AMH-4, we performed cytotoxicity studies on three human testicular tumor cell lines (NTERA-2 cL.D1, Cates-1B, Tera-1) and one human normal testicular cell line (Hs 1.Tes). The inhibitory effects of AMH-4 on above cells were detected using the MTT assay and IC 50  values were calculated. As shown in  Table 2 , AMH-4 had significant antiproliferative activity on human testicular tumor cells, including NTERA-2 cL.D1, Cates-1 B and Tera-1. Notably, AMH-4 showed significant antiproliferative activity on NTERA-2 cL.D1 (IC 50  = 0.12 μM) cells compared to Cates-1B (IC 50  = 0.34 μM) and Tera-1 (IC 50  = 0.25 μM) cells. Furthermore, AMH-4 had almost no inhibitory effect on the growth of normal human testicular cells Hs 1.Tes (IC 50  > 10 μM), suggesting that AMH-4 has less toxic side effects. In addition, we evaluated the inhibition rate of AMH-4 on the four cell lines mentioned above. As shown in  Figure S2 , AMH-4 suppressed the proliferation of three types of testicular tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner, with the strongest inhibitory effect on NTERA-2 cL.D1 cells. Meanwhile, AMH-4 had no apparent inhibitory effect on the normal testicular cell line. In conclusion, AMH-4 potently inhibited the proliferation of testicular cancer cells, particularly NTERA-2 cL.D1 cells, with low toxicity to normal testicular cells. Therefore, we chose NTERA-2 cL.D1 as xenograft cells for in vivo antitumor study of AMH-4.

Based on AMH-4 excellent antiproliferative activity in vitro, we evaluated the antitumor activity of AMH-4 in vivo in NTERA-2 cL.D1 xenograft models. Nude mice bearing tumor were randomly divided into four groups: vehicle, lartesertib, vorinostat and AMH-4, all at a concentration of 10 mg/kg. As shown in  Figure 8A , all treatment groups inhibited tumour growth compared to the vehicle throughout the treatment period. Obviously, AMH-4 showed the most significant antitumor effect compared to the positive drugs vorinostat and lartesertib. In addition, the group of mice treated with AMH-4 showed a slight increase in body weight, while a slight decrease was observed in the groups treated with vorinostat ( Figure 8B ). Thus, these results suggest that AMH-4 has excellent antitumor activity against testicular cancer with low toxicity, suggesting its potential for the treatment of testicular cancer.\n Figure 8 The antitumor activity of AMH-4 in NTERA-2 cL.D1 cell-derived xenografts.

The value of RMSD was calculated for the complex structure relative to the initial optimized structure. In  Figure 7A  and  B , The RMSD of the ATM-AMH-4 complex initially increased and remained stable at around 0.35 nm after 30 ns; the RMSD of the HDAC2-AMH-4 complex remained steady at around 0.2 nm after 10 ns, indicating that AMH-4 can bind stably to ATM and HDAC2. In addition, to assess the flexibility of the amino acid residues in the complex, the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values were also calculated ( Figure 7C  and  D ). As shown in  Figure 7C , the RMSF values of the key residues Pro2699, Leu2715, Lys2717, Leu2722, Tyr2755, Leu2767, Trp2769, Cys2770, and Ile2888 in the ATM active sites were all less than 0.2 nm throughout the simulation process, indicating that these key residues were stable in binding to AMH-4. In  Figure 7D , the RMSF values of key residues His145, His146, Phe155, Lys205, Tyr209, Phe210, Leu276, and Tyr308 in the HDAC2 active site show small fluctuations in intensity less than 0.1 nm, reflecting a strong interaction with AMH-4. Finally, the stability of the system was evaluated by analysing the changes in the secondary structure of the protein during the 50 ns MD simulation process. As shown in  Figure 7E  and  F , no significant changes were observed in the secondary structure of the protein, indicating the structural stability of ATM and HDAC2 in the complex. In conclusion, AMH-4 can stably bind to the active sites of ATM and HDAC2.\n Figure 7 MD simulation of AMH-4 in complex with ATM and HDAC2. ( A ) The backbone RMSD of the complex of ATM and AMH-4.

The inhibitory effects of AMH-4 on above cells were detected using the MTT assay and IC 50  values were calculated. As shown in  Table 2 , AMH-4 had significant antiproliferative activity on human testicular tumor cells, including NTERA-2 cL.D1, Cates-1 B and Tera-1. Notably, AMH-4 showed significant antiproliferative activity on NTERA-2 cL.D1 (IC 50  = 0.12 μM) cells compared to Cates-1B (IC 50  = 0.34 μM) and Tera-1 (IC 50  = 0.25 μM) cells. Furthermore, AMH-4 had almost no inhibitory effect on the growth of normal human testicular cells Hs 1.Tes (IC 50  > 10 μM), suggesting that AMH-4 has less toxic side effects. In addition, we evaluated the inhibition rate of AMH-4 on the four cell lines mentioned above. As shown in  Figure S2 , AMH-4 suppressed the proliferation of three types of testicular tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner, with the strongest inhibitory effect on NTERA-2 cL.D1 cells. Meanwhile, AMH-4 had no apparent inhibitory effect on the normal testicular cell line. In conclusion, AMH-4 potently inhibited the proliferation of testicular cancer cells, particularly NTERA-2 cL.D1 cells, with low toxicity to normal testicular cells. Therefore, we chose NTERA-2 cL.D1 as xenograft cells for in vivo antitumor study of AMH-4.

        "content": "Despite significant advances in the treatment of testicular cancer, the range of physical and psychological health problems caused by current cancer treatments cannot be overlooked. 6 , 7  Therefore, the development of drugs with low toxicity and minimal side effects for the treatment of testicular cancer is essential. In testicular cancer, activation of ATM may promote the survival and proliferation of tumor cells, while HDAC2 may influence tumor development by regulating gene expression. 18 , 30  In recent years, the development of dual-targeted inhibitors has been widely reported as a promising approach to improve drug efficacy or overcome resistance, and has become a popular area of research in cancer treatment. 48 , 49  Thus, inhibiting ATM and HDAC2 simultaneously may be an effective interventional strategy for testicular cancer treatment. However, due to the difference in the shape of the ATM and HDAC2 pockets, it is difficult to design inhibitors that target both ATM and HDAC2. In this study, we developed a series of ATM/HDAC2 dual-target inhibitor (AMHs 1–6) through a virtual screening approach based on pharmacophore screening and molecular docking. We have constructed pharmacophore models based on the structure of ATM (PDB ID: 7NI4) by identifying the key chemical features of active compounds, which are then used to screen large databases for compounds with similar features. Molecular docking was used to model the interactions between the compounds and the active binding site of ATM, from which potentially active compounds were screened. The combination of these two approaches can quickly, effectively and accurately screen out leads with greater potential. Subsequent biological evaluation showed that these compounds exhibited nanomolar inhibitory activity against ATM and HDAC2. In particular, AMH-4 with the lowest docking score identified by molecular docking showed excellent antitumor activity against testicular cancer both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that structure-based virtual screening is capable of identifying leads with biological activity and is a promising strategy in drug discovery and design. This provides a concrete foundation for future dual-target drug design. Despite recent advances in ATM and HDAC inhibitors, achieving a balance between toxicity and efficacy remains a challenge. Lartesertib is a potent, orally bioavailable ATM inhibitor in Phase I clinical trials. 16  In clinical practice, the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat has shown dose-limited toxicity and tolerability. 50  In this study, AMH-4 showed greater efficacy and lower toxicity compared to the positive controls lartesertib and vorinostat in the treatment of testicular cancer. In a xenograft mouse model of testicular cancer, AMH-4 exhibited more potent antitumor effects and less toxicity than the positive controls. These results suggest that AMH-4 is a potential therapeutic candidate for testicular cancer. In the future, it is expected that AMH-4 will be modified to further increase its inhibitory potency in testicular cancer. In addition, dual-targeted drugs are often challenged by membrane permeability and safety issues, which is a direction for further optimization in the future."

    "title": "Importance of Continuous Sequential Chemotherapy and Multimodal Treatment for Advanced Testicular Cancer",
    "abstract": "Abstract Patients with “difficult-to-treat” advanced testicular cancer can require multiple therapies. We retrospectively assessed our patients with advanced germ cell tumors (GCTs) and characterized the clinical efficacy, outcomes, and factors affecting overall survival (OS). Two hundred fifty-three patients with advanced GCTs were treated at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan, from June 1998 to September 2013. Of 253 patients, 142 patients had salvage chemotherapy. As first-line therapy, bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin, and etoposide and cisplatin therapies were performed in 234 cases (92.5%). As second-line therapy, etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin/vinblastine, ifosfamide, and cisplatin, and paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin/paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and nedaplatin therapies were carried out in 44 and 59 cases, respectively. Furthermore, 111, 72, 44, and 28 cases had third, fourth, fifth, and sixth-or-later-line chemotherapy, respectively. Five-year OS rate stratified by chemotherapy line was 95.5% in the first line, 89.4% in the second line, 82.1% in the third line, 45.1% in the fourth line, and 58.9% in the fifth or after line. A statistical significant difference was found when comparing fourth-or-after-line versus first to third-line therapy. Additional procedures were performed, including retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) (n = 168), extra-RPLN resection (n = 114), and external beam radiotherapy/stereotactic radiotherapy (n = 78). Multivariate analysis showed that factors predicting better outcomes were in serum tumor marker (STM) normalization, RPLND, and extra-RPLN resection. Good outcomes were obtained in patients who completed chemotherapy up to third line. After fourth-line chemotherapy, approximately 50% of “difficult-to-treat” patients could be cured with normalization of STM levels and residual mass resection. Continuous or sequential chemotherapy with multimodality therapy is important for patients with “difficult-to-treat” advanced GCTs. Effective chemotherapy after third line should be developed.",

        "content": "Advanced metastatic germ cell tumors (GCTs) can be cured in 80% of cases. 1  Survival improvement in poor prognosis should be noted in the modern chemotherapy era. Population-based analysis by Swedish–Norwegian group showed overall survival (OS) was 67.4% in poor prognosis. 2  However, 20% to 30% of cases of advanced GCTs require salvage chemotherapy, such as vinblastine, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VeIP), etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP), high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT), and paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP). Although VIP and VeIP therapy have been used as standard salvage therapy for 2 decades, no evidence of disease (NED) rate was approximately 30%. 3 , 4  These results led investigators to develop other therapies. HDCT was made possible by the development of peripheral stem cell blood harvest and transfusion. Two randomized control trials (RCTs) of HDCT as first salvage therapy (second-line) failed to show that HDCT was superior to standard-dose salvage therapy. 5 , 6  In addition, after failing HDCT therapy, it is very difficult to continue treatment. 7 TIP therapy as first salvage chemotherapy, introduced by Motzer in 2000, 8  results in a very good response rate (RR) in cases with specific prognostic features (eg, testis primary and first relapse after previous complete response [CR]). Other investigators tested TIP as second-line therapy for patients with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) failure and reported relatively good results with manageable adverse events. 9  Therefore, TIP has been recognized as a standard first salvage chemotherapy, especially for the patients with favorable prognostic features. Other salvage chemotherapies have been developed for advanced GCTs. Some of them seem to be good candidates for second-line treatment or for use after salvage chemotherapy. Gemcitabine and irinotecan in combination with cisplatin or its derivatives resulted in relatively good cure rates. 10 , 11  A regimen including gemcitabine or irinotecan has mainly been used as third-line therapy or after salvage chemotherapy. Guidelines equally recommend VeIP/VIP, TIP, and HDCT as second-line therapy. 12 – 14  With regard to third-line therapy, gemcitabine-containing regimens might be good candidates, but no specific regimen was mentioned recommended by the guidelines. To our knowledge, there are no definitive data to guide the sequential treatment regimens for patients with “difficult-to-treat” advanced testicular cancer. In addition, there are no reports that studied the entire treatment sequence and survival from induction chemotherapy to completion of treatment. Thus, the goal of this retrospective study was to assess the response and OS of sequential chemotherapy and additional modalities for patients with advanced GCT at each step of treatment, regardless of the chemotherapy regimen."

Patient characteristics are summarized in Table  1 . Of 253 patients, 111 patients had only first-line chemotherapy (induction group) and 142 patients had second-line-or-later chemotherapy (salvage group). The salvage group had worse initial clinical stage and International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group risk criteria compared with induction group. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan, and written informed consent for each treatment was obtained from all patients. Patient Characteristics We treated advanced patients with GCT according to our treatment strategy, as follows: Patients who achieved tumor marker normalization with residual mass had residual mass resection such as retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), cervical lymph node dissection, and visceral metastatic site resection. Patients without serum tumor markers (STMs) normalization after chemotherapy were treated with a subsequent chemotherapy. Our salvage chemotherapy strategy was as follows: second-line (TIP or paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and nedaplatin [TIN], third-line (irinotecan and cisplatin [IrP] or irinotecan and nedaplatin [IrN], fourth-line (paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin [TGP] or paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and nedaplatin [TGN]), and fifth-line-or-after (clinical trial). For the patients who had already been treated at another institution, our first selection was a therapy that had not been used for that patient before. If tumor marker level had been progressively decreasing, the current chemotherapy was continued. On the contrary, when tumor marker levels increased or if progressive disease (PD) was seen by radiographic studies, the patient was switched to a different chemotherapy. Extrabeam radiotherapy and/or radiofrequency ablation as alternative focal therapy were performed, even for nonseminoma patients, in the curative or palliative setting according to the physician's decision. For brain metastasis, stereotactic radiotherapy, such as γ-knife or cyber-knife, was selected first. When dissemination or relapse occurred, whole brain irradiation was considered. When viable cancer, not including teratoma, was found at residual mass resection, an additional 2 cycles of chemotherapy was typically performed. Patients who achieved tumor marker normalization with residual mass had residual mass resection such as retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), cervical lymph node dissection, and visceral metastatic site resection.

With regard to third-line therapy, the most commonly selected therapy was TIP or TIN therapy in 53 patients, and IrP or IrN were the second most commonly selected therapy (18 patients). The most common trend of sequential chemotherapy for “difficult-to-treat” GCTs was BEP/EP-TIP/TIN-IrP/IrN-TGP/TGN. The second most common sequential chemotherapy was BEP/EP-VeIP/VIP-TIP/TIN-IrP/IrN. Chemotherapy Sequence in Our Department, n = 253 With regard to additional procedures during or after chemotherapy, 150 surgeries and 14 radiation therapies were performed during or after first-line therapy. Out of 169 RPLND carried out, 156 were integrated with first, second, and third-line therapy. The RRs (CR + PR) for the second, third, and fourth-line therapies are shown in Table  3 .

        "content": "BEP therapy is widely used as first-line therapy for advanced testicular cancer. On the contrary, only 2 phase III trials of HDCT in the second-line setting have been performed, 4 , 5  and there are no RCTs of conventional-dose salvage chemotherapy. Therefore, guidelines do not recommend salvage chemotherapy. 12 – 14 Our institutional strategy for advanced GCT was BEP/EP as induction chemotherapy, TIP/TIN (substitute nedaplatin for cisplatin) as second-line, IrP/IrN as third-line, and TGP/TGN as fourth-line therapy. Therefore, TIP/TIN was the most common regimen selected as second line. The second most common choice for second-line therapy was VIP/VeIP. This is compatible with guidelines’ recommendation. In the third-line or later setting, paclitaxel, irinotecan, or gemcitabine were selected (Table  3 ). As shown in Table  6 , after introducing ifosfamide, VIP or VeIP has been used as second-line therapy. Although its efficacy was relatively good, long NED could be achieved in about 30%, which is suboptimal. 3 , 4  This led investigators to introduce HDCT with stem cell transfusion. Two RCTs did not show superiority of HDCT to conventional dose chemotherapy (CDCT). 5 , 6  These unsatisfactory results led to the development of new regimens with paclitaxel, 8 , 9 , 15  gemcitabine, 11 , 16 – 18  and irinotecan. 10 , 19 , 20  Most reports that have investigated chemotherapy regimens as second or third-line therapy showed relatively good results (OS of 20%–50%). Paclitaxel-containing therapy resulted in good survival rates when used in the second and third-line setting. From these results, the efficacy of HDCT was thought to be very limited, and paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy was promising as second or third-line therapy. In fact, our data showed that TIP/TIN resulted in a good response and in tumor marker normalization. For third-line therapy, our results showed an OS rate of 62.2%, which was better than the OS (20%) seen in previous studies. 11 , 15 , 16 , 19  In addition, sequential chemotherapy, even after fourth line, produced a good RR and a good OS rate. Reported Salvage Chemotherapy Recently, Necchi et al 21  used modified VIP as second-line therapy in a large cohort. This report showed that 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and 5-year OS was 34.3% and 42.1%, respectively. Another large retrospective study by Lorch et al 22  showed better second-line outcomes with HDCT than with CDCT. PFS in all subgroups was better after HDCT than CDCT and OS was better than CDCT in all except 1 (low risk). HDCT seemed to be superior to CDCT. However, since CDCT and HDCT regimen were varied and selection bias must exist in a retrospective nature, definitive conclusion could not be obtained. Therefore, superiority of CDCT or HDCT should be reevaluated in a prospective RCT for patients with poor prognostic features, such as TIGER (Randomized Phase III Trial of Initial Salvage Chemotherapy for Patients with Germ Cell Tumors) study. 23 Despite the absence of evidence from RCTs, TIP is effective first salvage chemotherapy. Furthermore, treatment options are more complicated in the third-line or later setting. Our sequential treatment strategy was comparable or better in terms of OS compared with reported literatures in each salvage chemotherapy line. These observations highlight the importance of sequential continuous chemotherapy integrated with residual mass resection. With regard to the best sequence up to third-line chemotherapy, the combination of TIP (microtubule polymerization inhibitor) as second line and gemcitabine (antimetabolite) as third line seems to be the most common sequence in the literature. Irinotecan (topoisomerase I inhibitor) was also a good candidate as second-line-or-later chemotherapy. However, we could not identify the best sequence in this series. Further investigation using anticancer agents with different mechanisms is required. Residual mass resection is an important and essential part of GCT treatment. 12 – 14  The rate of persistent viable cancer and teratoma are 10% and 40%, respectively, in the modern chemotherapy era. Disease-specific survival rate is reported to be 75% in the literature. 24 – 27  Our data involving patients with complicated background showed that viable cancer was found in 20.5% and that teratoma was found in 23.7%. The 5 and 10-year OS rate was 91.5% and 87.9%, respectively. These results are comparable to those from the previous reports. 24 – 27 The results of univariate and multivariate analysis suggest that it is very important to continue chemotherapy sequentially until STM normalization and resect residual mass, including RPLN and extra-RPLN, after finishing chemotherapy. Guidelines emphasize this point. 12 – 14 This study has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective study of unselected patients. Second, since multiple centers contributed and only a small number of patients started induction chemotherapy at our institution, the treatment strategy was inconsistent, and patient backgrounds were heterogeneous in each treatment. Third, prognostic factors were unadjusted when comparing RRs. This is the first report of sequential continuous treatment that described the response and survival in each treatment line in the real clinical world. We believe these data show the importance of sequential treatment for advanced GCTs, despite the various study limitations. In conclusion, this is the first report of multimodal and chemotherapeutic sequences for patients with advanced GCT. Sequential treatment for advanced GCTs, especially “difficult-to-treat” GCTs, is very important to improve outcomes. Very high cure rates were achieved in patients who completed chemotherapy up to third-line therapies. In addition, even in heavily treated patients who had fifth or sixth-line therapy, continuous treatment might save their lives if accompanied by additional modalities. More systematic trials that include third-line or fourth-line treatment are needed."

    "abstract": "Simple Summary Testicular cancer often requires additional treatment after chemotherapy to remove any remaining tumour tissue, particularly in the abdominal region. This procedure, called post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND), is complex and needs to be performed by skilled teams in specialized centres. This research examined the outcomes of this surgery in a high-volume national referral centre over several years. By studying over 160 patients, it was found that while the surgery is challenging and sometimes requires additional procedures like kidney removal, it is safe when conducted by experienced teams. These findings emphasize the importance of referring patients to specialized centres to ensure optimal care and minimise complications.",

        "content": "Testicular cancer is the most common cancer among young men between 15 and 40 years of age. The vast majority (98%) of all testicular cancers are germ cell tumours (TGCT) [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]. Current multimodal treatment, when necessary, provides a 10-year cancer-specific survival rate of >95% [ 5 ]. Survival highly depends on the timely and thorough quality of delivery of surgery and chemotherapy. Despite the effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy, 25% of patients have a residual retroperitoneal mass post-completion of systemic treatment [ 6 ]. The objective of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is to remove persistent lymph nodes as they contain teratoma or viable cancer in 30–40% and 10–20% of patients, respectively [ 7 ]. Teratomas require special attention as they are chemotherapy-resistant, may relapse years after initial treatment [ 8 ], and have an inherent risk of transforming into a somatic-type malignancy, which is often incurable [ 9 ]. Complete resection after initial chemotherapy can increase long-term disease-free survival up to 95%. The overall long-term relapse rate in patients undergoing RPLND ranges between 6% and 9% [ 10 ]. Due to the complex anatomy of the retroperitoneal space and the extensive desmoplastic reaction often seen after chemotherapy, especially in seminoma, pc-RPLND is a challenging surgical procedure that should be performed by experienced surgeons familiar with the retroperitoneal anatomy and able to perform complex surgical procedures on the vascular and intestinal structures [ 11 , 12 ]. In addition, pc-RPLND has been associated with higher morbidity compared to primary RPLND, with complication rates reported between 1.2 and 23.3% [ 13 , 14 ]. The associated morbidity is mainly attributed to the adjunctive procedures that may be required intraoperatively, such as resection of the kidney, vena cava, aorta, or bowel. Approximately one-third of patients will require an additional procedure that can lead to a prolonged hospital stay [ 15 ]. An attempt to minimise complications requires through knowledge of the retroperitoneal space, the relevant anatomical landmarks and resection templates, as well as multidisciplinary input intra- and postoperatively based on commonly agreed protocols. This retrospective study evaluated the safety of pc-RPLND for metastatic testicular cancer at a national referral centre. It also provides a detailed description of its clinical effectiveness according to histological subtypes, disease stage, sites of metastatic disease, and response to chemotherapy."

The departmental testicular cancer database was retrospectively reviewed, and all consecutive patients with testicular cancer who underwent pc-RPLND from 2008 to 2023 were included in the analysis. The indication for surgery was any residual mass ≥1 cm with normal or plateaued tumour markers after the completion of chemotherapy. RPLND was performed via an open transperitoneal approach by two senior uro-oncology surgeons. Boundaries of surgical dissection were the renal vessels cephalad, the ureters laterally, and the bifurcation of the iliac arteries caudal (full bilateral template). A modified unilateral template was used on selected patients based on the size of the retroperitoneal mass, its location in the retroperitoneum, its anatomical relation to other structures and the laterality of the primary testicular tumour. Right-sided modified template resection encompassed the precaval, paracaval, retrocaval, and interaortocaval regions. It also included the area lateral to the common iliac vessels, with the ureter crossing the iliac vessels serving as the caudal boundary and the ureter itself acting as the lateral boundary of dissection. The cranial boundary was defined by the renal vein, except in cases where retrocrural or suprahilar lymph node involvement was present. Left-sided modified template resection involved the preaortic and para-aortic regions up to the inferior mesenteric artery, as well as the retroaortic area. The crossing of the ureter over the iliac artery marked the caudal boundary, while the ureter served as the lateral boundary of dissection [ 11 ]. In all cases, a complete medical assessment was performed, including measurement of serum tumour markers (alpha-fetoprotein, AFP; β human chorionic gonadotropin, βHCG; and lactate dehydrogenase, LDH). Moreover, all patients were offered restaging chest and abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT). The maximum transverse diameter of the retroperitoneal mass on CT before and after chemotherapy completion was recorded. All patients had received systemic chemotherapy before undergoing RPLND. The most frequently used chemotherapeutic regimens were bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP, 3–4 cycles) or etoposide and cisplatin (EP, 4 cycles), while some patients received 2–4 cycles of paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP), cisplatin etoposide ifosfamide (VIP) or combinations of these chemotherapy regimens. The study recorded any adjunctive procedures performed during surgery. Intraoperative adverse events (iAE) and postoperative complications were systematically recorded and classified using the ClassIntra v1.0 and the Clavien-Dindo classification systems [ 16 , 17 ]. Complications were recorded either during regular follow-up clinic visits or via telephone follow-up appointments. The follow-up protocol included complete blood count, blood biochemistry, including AFP, βHCG, and LDH levels every 3 months, and chest–abdomen–pelvis CT scans every 6 months for a 2-year period and ten once a year in line with the relevant European Urology Association guidelines [ 18 ]. Patient demographics, clinicopathological characteristics and intra- and postoperative complications were analysed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v.29 program. Continuous variables with normal distribution are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) and non-normally distributed data as medians (Q1–Q3), while categorical variables are presented as proportions. The statistical analysis involved the use of the chi-square test to assess associations between categorical variables.

        "content": "A total of 165 consecutive pc-RPLNDs were performed at the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece during the study period. All patients were referred to our centre after completion of platinum-based chemotherapy and, in the majority of the cases, their pre-operative serum biomarkers were within the normal range. Seven patients (4.2%) had elevated tumour markers (plateaued), while another 4 (2.5%) underwent salvage RPLND after the completion of salvage chemotherapy. An assessment of disease stage showed that 16 (9.7%), 31 (18.8%), 49 (29.7%) and 69 (41.8%) patients were diagnosed with stage IIA, IIB, IIC and III disease, respectively. The median (Q1–Q3) maximum diameter of retroperitoneal masses on CT scans prior to RPLND was 50 mm (26.75–81.25 mm). Patients’ demographics and baseline clinical characteristics are presented in  Table 1 . Three patients were excluded from final analysis; two due to unresectable mass identified intraoperatively and one due to intraoperative death secondary to massive hemothorax. Of the remaining 162 patients, 125 (77%) were offered full bilateral dissection, while the remaining 37 patients (23%) had template dissection. The median (Q1–Q3) duration of the procedure was 4.9 h (4–6 h), and the estimated blood loss was 300 mL (120–740). According to the ClassIntra v1.0 classification of intraoperative adverse events (iAE), 20 patients (12.4%) had a grade I intraoperative complication (mostly due to bleeding above average) with no need for additional intervention, eight patients (5%) had a grade II complication (ureteric injury in seven patients with ureteric stent placement, and major vessel injury in one patient who needed stenting of the left internal iliac artery), while, as mentioned above, one patient died intraoperatively due to massive hemothorax and was classified as a grade V complication. In 38/162 patients (23.4%, at least one additional procedure was required. More specifically, 18/162 (11.1%) patients underwent synchronous nephrectomy, one patient (0.6%) underwent renal autotransplant, three patients (1.9%) required intraoperative insertion of ureteric stent, while ureteric reconstruction in the form of transureteroureterostomy (TUU) or ureteric replacement with ileal graft were performed in three (1.9%) and one patient (0.6%), respectively. Vascular stenting of the left internal iliac artery was required in one case (0.6%), and excision of IVC was performed in five cases (3.1%) due to thrombosis. One patient (0.6%) was offered a total reconstruction of IVC and aorta from the level of the renal vessels to common iliac vessels with the use of synthetic grafts, to allow for complete resection of residual mass. Additionally, three patients (1.9%) with visceral metastatic disease underwent partial hepatectomy, one (0.6%) underwent hepatic metastasectomy with radiofrequency ablation, while partial vertebrectomy was offered to one (0.6%) additional patient. All intraoperative parameters are shown in  Table 2 . Within the first 30 postoperative days, 40 out of 162 patients (24.7%) experienced at least one complication. According to the Clavien-Dindo Classification of postoperative complications, the most common Grade I complication was excessive lymphatic leakage in 28/162 patients (17.3%), requiring prolonged percutaneous drainage post-discharge. Moreover, three (1.9%) patients developed fever, managed with conventional antipyretics. Grade II complications were reported in a total of eight (4.9%) patients: four patients had an infection (chest or wound infection) requiring antibiotics, ileus was recorded in two cases and two additional patients suffered episodes of pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis. One patient developed wound dehiscence and was managed with surgical intervention under general anaesthesia (Grade IIIb). No grade IV or V complications were reported. Complications were three times more common in patients with full bilateral resection templates compared to those who were offered template resections. (chi-square: 4.969, df: 1,  p  = 0.026, OR = 3.34 with 96% CI: 1.102–10.101) ( Table 3 ). The median (Q1–Q3) length of hospital stay was 8 (7–10) days. Histopathological examination of the pc-RPLND specimen showed that teratomas were the most frequent finding (83/162, 51.2%), followed by fibrosis/necrosis without residual viable tumour (64/162, 39.5%). The retroperitoneal lymph nodes of two patients contained rhabdomyosarcoma, nephroblastoma and adenocarcinoma components due to the progression of immature teratoma. Detailed histopathological findings of the entire pc-RPLND cohort and a summary of postoperative parameters are shown in  Table 4 . Out of the total cohort, 11 out of 165 individuals were identified with seminoma upon initial histopathological evaluation. The median age at diagnosis was 38 years (28.75–45.5 years). Among these patients, six (54.5%) underwent BEP chemotherapy, three (27.3%) received EP, and two (18.2%) were treated with a combination of BEP and TIP. Staging assessments revealed that two patients (18.2%) had stage IIA, another two (18.2%) had stage IIB, four (36.4%) presented with stage IIC, and three (27.3%) were diagnosed with stage III disease. The median (Q1–Q3) maximum diameter of retroperitoneal masses observed on pre-RPLND CT scans was 63.5 mm (33.75–107 mm). The majority of patients (9/11; 81.8%) underwent complete bilateral pc-RPLND, while two individuals (18.2%) underwent a modified template procedure. The median (Q1–Q3) duration of the procedure was 5.5 h (4.9–7.0 h). According to the ClassIntra v1.0 classification system for intraoperative adverse events (iAEs), seven patients (63.6%) experienced grade I complications, primarily due to above-average bleeding, which did not necessitate additional interventions. Grade II complications occurred in two patients (9.1%) and were attributed to ureteric injuries that required stent placement. Additional surgical procedures were performed in four out of 11 patients (36.4%). Specifically, synchronous nephrectomy was conducted in two cases (18.2%), intraoperative ureteric stent placement was required in one case (9.1%), and partial vertebrectomy was carried out in another patient (9.1%). Within the first 30 days postoperatively, four patients (36.4%) encountered at least one complication. Based on the Clavien-Dindo classification, two patients (18.2%) experienced excessive lymphatic leakage (classified as Grade I), and two others (18.2%) developed wound infections (classified as Grade II). The median (Q1–Q3) length of hospitalization was 10.5 days (7.25–12.75 days). Histopathological analysis of the pc-RPLND specimens revealed that fibrosis or necrosis was the predominant finding, occurring in eight patients (72.7%), while residual seminoma was detected in three patients (27.3%)."

        "content": "Centralisation of care for patients with metastatic testicular cancer has been associated with better outcomes in terms of postoperative complications, disease-free survival and overall survival [ 19 ]. The current study assessed the safety outcomes of post-chemotherapy RPLND for the management of testicular cancer over a 15-year period at a national referral centre. The present study shows that the most common additional procedure in the patient cohort was total nephrectomy performed in one-tenth of patients, followed by vascular and ureteric reconstructions. The need for additional procedures is higher in bigger masses (particularly >5 cm in size) as well as in intermediate- and poor-prognosis IGCCCG patients [ 20 ]. In this study, this correlation was not examined since the majority of the patients in this cohort had retroperitoneal masses with a median maximum diameter of 5 cm. The rate of additional interventions in this study was 23.5%, confirming the complexity of PC-RPLND as a result of extensive tissue plane distortion of by the enlarged mass, and direct infiltration of the tumour to local structures, such as the ureter, aorta, and vena cava. In general, the frequency of additional procedures ranges between 13% and 38%, with nephrectomy and vascular procedures representing the most common ones [ 15 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ]. In the presence of tumour extension into the renal hilum, nephrectomy is inevitable, and histopathological examination of the resected kidney shows pathological infiltration in more than half of patients. Malignant infiltration of the lumbar spine is very rare (3–9% of GCT patients) and only a few vertebrectomy cases have been reported [ 25 , 26 , 27 ]. In the current study, one patient underwent partial lumbar vertebrectomy secondary to tumour infiltration. Additionally, four cases of partial hepatectomy and radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases are reported. Overall, reports of liver metastasectomy in TGCTs remain scarce. According to Jacobsen et al. [ 28 ]  ,  there is a high rate (51%) of histological discordance between RPLND and liver lesion specimens, with 73% of liver lesions containing only necrosis. The overall complication rate in this study (40 patients, 24.7%) is similar to the reports in the literature (12–32% of patients) [ 11 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ]. Most of the studied patients experienced Grade I or II Clavien-Dindo complications, with only one Grade IIIb complication recorded. No Grade IV or V complications were recorded. The complication rate has been proven to correlate with the setting of RPLND (primary vs. pc-RPLND), with a higher rate of intraoperative and postoperative complications in the pc-RPLND series. Moreover, the extent of RPLND is another key factor determining postoperative complications of these patients. Recently, a large multicentre study in the Scandinavian population compared intra- and postoperative complications in patients who underwent unilateral or bilateral pc-RPLND [ 33 ]. Bilateral pc-RPLND was associated with a higher frequency of postoperative complications (45% vs. 25% in unilateral), while 8.3% of the patients had ≥ Grade 3b events (vs 2.2% in unilateral procedures). A recent systematic review comparing outcomes of different pc-RPLND techniques, confirms the higher incidence of major complications (Grade III-V) in patients undergoing full bilateral RPLND (18%) compared to complications associated with unilateral template RPLND (8%) [ 34 ]. This study shows that patients who underwent full bilateral RPLND had three times as many complications as those who underwent a template RPLND ( p  = 0.026, OR = 3.37 with 96% CI: 1.102–10.101). Histology of the excised masses after pc-RPLND is a key determinant of prognosis in patients with viable GCT or teratoma. However, considering its high morbidity, pc-RPLND offers no benefit in patients with residual fibrosis or necrosis. In our centre, the rate of necrosis/fibrosis of the residual mass was 39.5%, which is a bit lower than the reported literature rates (47–67%) [ 15 , 35 , 36 ], while patients with teratoma represented 51.9% of cases, slightly higher than the reported rate of 30–40% [ 7 ] This may be attributed to the referral pattern of the centre and the fact that the majority of TGC patients receive aggressive chemotherapy regimens from their attending oncologists, resulting in the referral of those who have an absolute indication for pc-RPLND. The study’s primary limitations, such as its retrospective, non-randomized, and unblinded design, must be emphasized. Conducted at a single centre, it predominantly reflects local experiences, with findings applicable only to open RPLND procedures. Additionally, the potential confounding effect of increasing surgeon and team experience should be considered, as surgical outcomes typically improve with greater case volume. However, despite these limitations, it is important to acknowledge that the major strength of this study is that comprises consecutive patients operated by the same surgeon and managed perioperatively by the same team over a 15-year period."

    "title": "Health-Related Quality of Life Following Treatment for Testicular Cancer: A Qualitative Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Testicular cancer (TCa) can precipitate ongoing psychosocial/physical morbidity post-treatment, despite high rates of cure. We conducted a systematic review to synthesise three decades of primary qualitative research on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) to inform the design of supportive care pathways. We queried MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science for all qualitative studies published up to 26 October 2022 examining issues relevant to HRQoL in post-treatment TCa patients. Two independent reviewers appraised included studies for methodological quality using established guidance for evidence-based public health policy and analysed findings via thematic synthesis. Studies were analytically weighted by study quality. Studies were evaluated using GRADE-CERQual to produce confidence levels in findings. We included 18 studies, comprising 387 participants. Seven studies were graded high quality, eight medium quality, and three low quality. Emergent analytical themes were: (a) Residual psychological injury; (b) Information deficits and unnecessary anxiety; (c) Thwarted life trajectory; (d) Social disruption; (e) Undermined youth; (f) Health service abandonment; (g) Long-term sexual problems; and (h) Maladaptive coping and post-traumatic stress. All findings were deemed ‘high confidence’, except theme (g), which was of ‘moderate confidence’. A limitation of the review was the relative dominance of Anglophone countries in the included studies. Some men treated for TCa are at risk of a range of post-treatment HRQoL issues, particularly psychosocial issues. Some individuals may be more at risk than others, based on specific personality traits, access to accurate and complete information about treatment recovery, and individual coping responses.",

        "content": "Testicular cancer (TCa) is one of the most common cancers amongst younger males and approximately 74,000 cases are reported per year globally, with population-adjusted incidence rates continuing to rise ( Huang et al., 2022 ). Data from high-resourced regions such as those in Europe and North America demonstrate that TCa has, in recent decades, become a highly survivable disease ( Cheng et al., 2018 ;  Ehrlich et al., 2015 ). Beyond these statistics, it is increasingly recognised that young men who receive treatment for TCa may experience challenges to their health-related quality of life (HRQoL), including both physical and psychosocial problems which may persist beyond typical follow-up and discharge ( Cappuccio et al., 2018 ;  Mercieca-Bebber et al., 2021 ;  Patrikidou et al., 2023 ). While tools exist for quantifying HRQoL issues in TCa (e.g.,  Hoyt et al., 2013 ;  Sztankay et al., 2018 ), recent analyses have identified shortcomings in these tools when subjected to comprehensive scrutiny of their psychometric attributes, including their content validity (i.e., whether a measure comprehensively measures all issues that it should) ( Dincer et al., 2021 ;  Rovito et al., 2021 ). Recent work undertaken by members of this group found that many TCa patients who are in the post-treatment phase find that existing patient-reported outcome measures omit questions that are important to them ( Cazzaniga et al., 2023 ). Such findings undermine attempts to consolidate our understanding of the issues faced by this patient cohort after treatment (e.g.,  Mercieca-Bebber et al., 2021 ), given that limitations in tools unavoidably translate into limitations in findings. This systematic review was undertaken as part of a wider prospective study (DISTANCE) that aims to consolidate our understanding of these post-treatment HRQoL issues and how they might be addressed in clinical practice, based on a broad analysis of all available quantitative and qualitative studies relevant to post-treatment HRQoL issues in TCa patients. To date, three decades of primary qualitative findings have not yet been synthesised, are often disparate, and can be challenging to interpret in terms of day-to-day considerations in clinical practice. The post-treatment HRQoL experiences of TCa patients have therefore largely remained clinical anecdotes which are of limited use. Hence, in our approach to this review, we aimed to close this gap and inform uro-oncology clinicians by producing formalised, yet ontologically open-ended empirical evidence based on the numerous existing qualitative studies examining post-treatment HRQoL issues in TCa patients."

        "content": "Methods are reported in accordance with the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) statement ( Tong et al., 2012 ). The review was not preregistered, and no ethics approval was sought, as the original objective related primarily to the wider DISTANCE study. Consequently, this synthesis was not pre-planned. However, an appraisal of the search strategy used for DISTANCE indicated that a comprehensive qualitative evidence synthesis was feasible. The research questions for the synthesis were: Research question 1: What are the transferable insights that can be gained from studies examining experiences of men treated for TCa that are relevant to their HRQoL? Research question 2: What are the relationships between these insights and: (a) treatment(s) received; (b) life phases; (c) time since treatment; and (d) personal individual differences between patients? Using a pre-planned (i.e., non-iterative) search strategy executed as part of the wider DISTANCE study, we queried MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science on 26 October 2022 (for full search strategy, see  Supplemental Material 1 ). The databases were chosen due to their coverage of three key domains of medical practice, psychosocial phenomena, and nursing practice. All retrieved records were independently screened for inclusion by two reviewers (LF and IR). Broadly, the inclusion criteria were: (1) any peer-reviewed original research study; (2) of qualitative design; (3) utilising primary or secondary data analysis; (4) which examined the experiences of adult individuals diagnosed with TCa; (5) in which the research aim, objective, or primary or secondary research question(s) place those experiences in the context of a TCa diagnosis of either the participant, or someone known to the participant (full inclusion/exclusion criteria contained in  Supplemental Material 2 ). Records were screened for inclusion/exclusion first by review of their titles, then their abstracts, and then full-text articles. Disagreements between reviewers about inclusion were resolved via reasoned discussion. A third reviewer was to be involved in case of impasse but was ultimately not required. Quality appraisal of all included studies was undertaken to enable analytical weighting of study insights. At the time of undertaking this review, there were no universally agreed criteria for qualitative study appraisal (the CAMELOT tool [ Munthe-Kaas et al., 2024 ], which addresses this issue, was published in June 2024). The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool ( Long et al., 2020 ) is most used; however, this tool was designed (and indeed is only intended to be used) as a pedagogical instrument and was considered less suitable for our aims. Rather, we opted to use criteria outlined by guidance [PMG4] of the Centre for Public Health Excellence of the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which informs public health policy decision making in the UK ( National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2012 ). The PMG4 guideline on qualitative study appraisal is an amalgamation of three other quality appraisal checklists as a pragmatic response to a lack of a universally agreed tool. On review, we judged it to possess stronger analytical coverage of the CASP tool and better suited to our objectives. All included studies were independently critically appraised by two reviewers (LF and CM) in accordance with the criteria outlined in NICE [PMG4]. Disagreements were identified per individual appraisal criterion and were categorised as either ‘partial disagree’ (one neutral appraisal and one positive/negative appraisal) or ‘opposing disagree’ (one positive appraisal and one negative appraisal). Each disagreement was resolved via discussion. Following appraisal of all criteria, each study was categorised as ‘High quality’, ‘Medium quality’, or ‘Low quality’ in accordance with the approach outlined in NICE [PMG4]. We undertook a thematic synthesis of the data based on the method outlined by  Thomas and Harden (2008) , using NVivo 14 (Lumivero). Thematic synthesis was deemed an appropriate approach to produce the type of generalised insights required for our applied setting. The analytical approach was modified to enable analytical weighting of study insights according to methodological quality of each study, using the method proposed by  Long et al. (2020) . In brief, the method stipulates that insights taken from high-quality studies are analysed first and comprise the primary coding index, which is inductively constructed from these studies only. Insights from the medium-quality studies are then integrated into this coding index, with new codes created from these studies only if the insight provided is deemed to be highly relevant and adjunctive to existing codes, and/or consistent with/integral to an emergent thematic pattern. Insights from low-quality studies are then used only to corroborate insights obtained from higher-quality studies (i.e., they are not used to produce any additional new codes). In this way, all data codes underpinning the final analytical themes are based on data that has a robust methodological grounding. Text contained in the  Results  and  Discussion  sections of the included articles was independently coded by two reviewers (LF and CM) in line with the above approach. Pragmatic coding was undertaken, in which segments of text were deductively identified in accordance with their relevance to the above research question(s). Codes were then produced inductively from the data, independently by both reviewers, and integrated into a single code structure based on a code-by-code discussion between reviewers, enabling the triangulation of descriptive and, where feasible, conceptual themes. First, high-quality studies were used to produce a primary coding structure as described above (with a review meeting after coding the first study to ensure methodological alignment). Where possible, all codes were labelled with attributes according to the circumstances they pertained to (e.g., what treatment had been received; what the relative age of the patient was; whether the patient was in education; whether the patient had a family; specific personality traits etc.). Then, LF and CM met to: (a) integrate the two coding structures into one via a code-by-code discussion of all codes; (b) refine the names and definitions of resultant unified codes based on agreed conceptual definitions; and (c) begin to develop descriptive themes. Then, medium-quality studies were coded into this thematic structure as described above; and following this, LF and CM met once again to integrate the newly semi-divergent thematic structures into one, similarly to above; and to refine the descriptive themes. Low-quality studies were then deductively coded in accordance with the already existing code structure. LF and CM then had a series of discussions of the data to ensure alignment on the analytical structure of the emerging themes and associated sub-themes and to develop integrated analytical themes based on the logical, conceptual relationships or overlap between the descriptive themes and the properties of the different data insights (i.e., pertaining to what specific type of patient or treatment), in terms of the known circumstances of the patients that produced that data. Once the synthesis was complete, the individual review findings (i.e., the analytical themes), and the data underpinning them, were retroactively evaluated by three reviewers (TGH, CM, and LF) to ascertain a confidence level of the validity of each individual finding, using the GRADE-CERQual approach outlined by  Lewin et al. (2018) . GRADE-CERQual is a methodical way of producing a concise summary of key findings; the reviewers’ confidence in each finding based on the potential for methodological issues to be underlying the finding; and concise summaries of methodological concerns (if any) that may undermine confidence in each finding."

Pragmatic coding was undertaken, in which segments of text were deductively identified in accordance with their relevance to the above research question(s). Codes were then produced inductively from the data, independently by both reviewers, and integrated into a single code structure based on a code-by-code discussion between reviewers, enabling the triangulation of descriptive and, where feasible, conceptual themes. First, high-quality studies were used to produce a primary coding structure as described above (with a review meeting after coding the first study to ensure methodological alignment). Where possible, all codes were labelled with attributes according to the circumstances they pertained to (e.g., what treatment had been received; what the relative age of the patient was; whether the patient was in education; whether the patient had a family; specific personality traits etc.). Then, LF and CM met to: (a) integrate the two coding structures into one via a code-by-code discussion of all codes; (b) refine the names and definitions of resultant unified codes based on agreed conceptual definitions; and (c) begin to develop descriptive themes. Then, medium-quality studies were coded into this thematic structure as described above; and following this, LF and CM met once again to integrate the newly semi-divergent thematic structures into one, similarly to above; and to refine the descriptive themes. Low-quality studies were then deductively coded in accordance with the already existing code structure. LF and CM then had a series of discussions of the data to ensure alignment on the analytical structure of the emerging themes and associated sub-themes and to develop integrated analytical themes based on the logical, conceptual relationships or overlap between the descriptive themes and the properties of the different data insights (i.e., pertaining to what specific type of patient or treatment), in terms of the known circumstances of the patients that produced that data."

While curative treatment is a precondition for recovery from psychological injuries, it does not precipitate such recovery in all cases. Information deficit can compound psychological issues. ○ Information deficit related to oncological prospects of TCa patients can cause, or exacerbate, ongoing anxiety post-treatment. ○ Information deficit related to what to expect in the post-treatment recovery phase (and transition to survivorship) may produce psychologically destabilising uncertainty, which may feed into fear and anxiety. ○ Information deficit related to oncological prospects of TCa patients can cause, or exacerbate, ongoing anxiety post-treatment. ○ Information deficit related to what to expect in the post-treatment recovery phase (and transition to survivorship) may produce psychologically destabilising uncertainty, which may feed into fear and anxiety. Damage to fertility increases the likelihood of present or future psychological injury. ○ Relatively older men (in their mid-to-late twenties, or in their thirties) who are in relationships are more likely to suffer immediate psychological injury. ○ Relatively younger men (adolescents and early twenties) who have not much considered child-rearing may be at less risk for immediate psychological injury, but may experience future psychological injury not any less serious. ○ The immediate physical threat of a yet-to-be-treated cancer may cause patients to attempt to relegate fertility concerns as a low priority and not act upon them (by sperm banking) until it is too late. Certain behaviour by the clinical team has the potential to encourage this de-prioritisation. ○ Relatively older men (in their mid-to-late twenties, or in their thirties) who are in relationships are more likely to suffer immediate psychological injury. ○ Relatively younger men (adolescents and early twenties) who have not much considered child-rearing may be at less risk for immediate psychological injury, but may experience future psychological injury not any less serious. ○ The immediate physical threat of a yet-to-be-treated cancer may cause patients to attempt to relegate fertility concerns as a low priority and not act upon them (by sperm banking) until it is too late.

Surgical treatments can produce long-term body image issues. ○ Some men will experience body image issues related to orchiectomy. However, this may not be as prevalent in this treatment population as might be commonly assumed. ▪ Such body image issues may be likely to arise as a function of the extent that the individual perceives their testicle as emblematic of an idealised masculinity. ○ Threats to body image are relatively more salient for many men who have visible surgical scars; this is due to their outward appearance instigating cancer disclosure to others. ○ Some men will experience body image issues related to orchiectomy.

An information deficit regarding oncological risk, or what to expect from the recovery phase, can put recovering TCa patients at higher risk of anxiety; and produce a psychologically destabilising sense of uncertainty. Information deficit related to treatment recovery can produce a destabilising sense of uncertainty, which can thwart crucial normalisation processes post-treatment. Information deficit related to the recurrence rate can lead to unnecessary anxiety. The presence of a supportive person (e.g., family member, partner, friend) at appointments may make a materially positive difference to how much information a patient is able to absorb. TCa can be strongly disruptive to a patient’s preconceived ideas of their life trajectory. Disruptions to social life trajectory are possible, particularly for relatively younger patients. Disruptions to educational and/or professional life trajectories are possible, particularly for relatively younger patients. In adolescent patients, this may result in increased dependence on parents and subsequently a lack of young adult autonomy. Disruptions to prospective family life are possible (i.e., starting a family), particularly for those hoping to start a family soon. Important social dynamics between the patient and others in their life can be disrupted by the TCa experience. Individuals in long-term committed relationships are relatively less likely to report significant negative disruption to relationships than individuals in less established, short-term relationships. Those in less established, shorter-term relationships may experience negative disruption to those relationships. Patients who are not in a relationship are likely to experience anxiety about prospective romantic relationships. Such anxieties can be particularly salient for men who have had orchiectomy, but it can apply to any patients, regardless of treatment type. The cancer event can cause alienation of the patient from certain friends, who, for various possible reasons, may lack the capability to engage with the patient’s experience. Patients may find workplace peers and superiors to be either accommodating and supportive, or troublesome and/or actively unsupportive, depending on their workplace context. The latter situation produces additional stress and anxiety. Patients with their own families may psychologically suffer due to a perceived inability to perform self-imposed family roles, as a result of maladaptive coping in response to their experience. Patients’ sense of youthful vitality and sense of young-adult autonomy can be undermined by TCa. In some adolescent patients, a lack of professional/financial independence can make a patient re-dependent upon their parents; particularly as parents are likely to step into a carer role during a patient’s treatment, hence providing a pathway to re-dependence when combined with the temporary cessation of progress in the patient’s education or professional development. Engagement with hobbies that were enjoyed prior to diagnosis can act as anchors of continuity, and hence be an effective restoration method, contributing to normalisation processes. Similarly to above, engaging in physical activity can provide a vehicle for a patient to reconnect with and taking back control of their body and mind. ○ Physical activity may provide a useful psychologically therapeutic ‘trojan horse’ in the cases of emotionally closed patients who might resist other methods of psychological support or therapy. ○ Physical activity may provide a useful psychologically therapeutic ‘trojan horse’ in the cases of emotionally closed patients who might resist other methods of psychological support or therapy. For some patients, in-person follow-up appointments involving having to go to a hospital can physically and psychologically interfere with important normalisation processes. Some patients experience feelings of health service abandonment following completion of treatment and follow-up. Feelings of health service abandonment following discharge can precede – and perhaps precipitate – the onset of emotional crises linked to the trauma of the patient’s experience with TCa. The removal of ongoing support is experienced as an acute psychological event by some patients, and this may be particularly true for patients with residual issues (physical or psychological). Patients may experience long-term disruption to their sex life. Some patients may feel unable to engage in sex due to physical problems such as pain or erectile issues. Some patients may experience powerful anxiety in anticipation of sexual situations. Some patients may experience decreased physical pleasure during sexual intercourse. Individuals with a recent history of TCa treatment are at risk of maladaptive coping responses and emergent post-traumatic stress after being discharged from care. Post-traumatic stress experiences may manifest sometime after routine follow-up and discharge. The risk of a general maladaptive coping response may be higher if: ○ The patient is not in a relationship and lacks reliable peers for support. ○ The patient is relatively less able to be cognitively flexible about life goals not yet achieved, which are important to them. ○ The patient has personality characteristics that inflexibly conform to traditional cultural norms around gender. ▪ The above may be compounded by treatment with orchiectomy. ▪ The above may be compounded by treatments impacting fertility (if the patient is childless). ○ The patient has lacked an opportunity, throughout the provision of their care, to have the mental space to reflect on their situation in a supportive environment. ○ The patient experiences the transition from follow-up to discharge (and beyond) as a psychologically disruptive event. ○ The patient is not in a relationship and lacks reliable peers for support. ○ The patient is relatively less able to be cognitively flexible about life goals not yet achieved, which are important to them. ○ The patient has personality characteristics that inflexibly conform to traditional cultural norms around gender. ▪ The above may be compounded by treatment with orchiectomy. ▪ The above may be compounded by treatments impacting fertility (if the patient is childless). ▪ The above may be compounded by treatment with orchiectomy. ▪ The above may be compounded by treatments impacting fertility (if the patient is childless). ○ The patient has lacked an opportunity, throughout the provision of their care, to have the mental space to reflect on their situation in a supportive environment. ○ The patient experiences the transition from follow-up to discharge (and beyond) as a psychologically disruptive event. The outcome of the GRADE-CERQual evaluation of the synthesis findings is presented in  Table 2 , which displays the confidence level of each finding as per the GRADE-CERQual criteria. As per GRADE-CERQual criteria, there was deemed to be ‘high confidence’ in seven of the eight core findings (i.e., the analytical themes). One of the core findings, ‘Health service abandonment’, was deemed to be of ‘moderate confidence’. We had some ‘minor’ concerns and some ‘moderate’ concerns regarding the criteria of  coherence ,  adequacy , or  relevance  of the data, for some of the findings. We had no concerns regarding the  methodological limitations  criterion with regard to any of the findings. GRADE-CERQual Assessment of Qualitative Evidence Across Eight Core Findings."

        "section_name": "Discussion",
        "content": "The results of our review help to empirically codify some key HRQoL issues in TCa patients, which may be anecdotally familiar to many urology clinicians, and have consolidated key insights which are worthy of consideration in care pathways for TCa patients. The results show that numerous good quality qualitative studies demonstrate that TCa patients can experience residual psychological injuries; experience unnecessary anxiety due to information deficits; feel that their life trajectory has been thwarted; experience disruption to their friendships or short-term romantic relationships; experience undermined youthfulness and young-adult autonomy; experience feelings of health service abandonment following discharge from care; experience long-term (psycho)sexual problems; and in certain circumstances, engage in maladaptive coping responses or experience delayed-onset post-traumatic stress. The evidence reported here is consistent with quantitative research on TCa survivors of >6 m indicating that HRQoL in TCa survivors post-treatment is most impacted by psychosocial, rather than physical, issues; and that while most patients experience only mild psychosocial morbidity, a smaller vulnerable subgroup demonstrate severe morbidity ( Smith et al., 2016 ;  Yamashita et al., 2021 ). The strength of qualitative approaches such as those represented here is that we can identify precisely what events and circumstances precipitate and govern HRQoL morbidity, which can produce informed solutions to enhance the supportive care pathway. A limitation of the qualitative approach is uncertainty regarding the actual incidence/prevalence of the issues reported. Hence, it is informative that existing quantitative findings align with the findings we report in our review, demonstrating that the issues outlined in our results are indeed likely to represent a considerable HRQoL burden in the TCa survivor population. It has been estimated that approximately one in five TCa survivors are, at any given time, experiencing moderate, severe, or extremely severe depression, anxiety, or stress, which is approximately 50% greater prevalence than comparable normative data ( Smith et al., 2016 ). In particular, quantitative data has indicated that patients in receipt of both chemotherapy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) together may be at heightened risk in terms of disruption to the life course and HRQoL ( Yamashita et al., 2021 ). The data we reviewed were limited in this regard, as links to chemotherapy and RPLND were not made explicit in the reviewed data. However, there were many references to ‘recovery from treatment’, from which it can perhaps be deduced – considering the quantitative evidence – that this therapeutic regimen played a role in the HRQoL issues documented, in some cases. While we were unable to expound upon appropriate supportive care solutions within the scope of this article (this will form the basis of future work), we can provide some cursory insights on supportive measures that may be useful for addressing HRQoL that incidentally emerged from our analysis of these qualitative studies: Upfront, realistic, comprehensive information on what to expect from the recovery phase. Support strategies acknowledging patriarchal influences on patients’ lived experiences of TCa, including evaluation of general psychological adaptability and support-seeking behaviour. Pro-active sperm banking advice and protocols, which acknowledge that amid diagnosis, a patient may lack ‘headspace’ to make a decision about sperm banking by themselves. Opportunities for patients to psychologically reflect and process their experience during their care, and sustained follow-up to monitor for manifestations of post-traumatic stress. Innovative peer-support interventions acceptable to this relatively younger, male patient demographic (e.g., group physical activity signposting or digital solutions). There were some limitations to this review. The methodology precludes the quantification of the relative burden of the reported issues across the TCa patient population. Furthermore, most (although not all) included studies were from the UK, USA, and Canada, which raises issues of cross-cultural transferability. This review consolidates qualitative insights that are crucial to providing comprehensive care for post-treatment TCa patients. The information reported in this review can be taken forward to assist in the update and development of existing and new HRQoL measurement tools for those affected by TCa and to enhance supportive care pathways based on the conclusions below."

        "content": "Testicular cancer is the most common malignant tumor in men between the ages of 15 and 34 [ 1 ]. Most bone metastases from testicular cancer are found in advanced cases where metastatic lesions have already spread to other sites, or in recurrent cases [ 2 ,  3 ]. Isolated distant bone metastases are rarely found at the initial diagnosis. We report a case of complete remission achieved by stereotactic radiotherapy for isolated bone metastases following four courses of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy for testicular cancer."

        "content": "A 42‐year‐old man noticed a swelling of the right testicle that persisted for 1 month, and consequently consulted our department. Tumor markers were high, with alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP) at 2058 ng/mL and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) at 136.2 mIU/mL, and computed tomography (CT) showed para‐aortic lymphadenopathy but no distant metastases (Figure  1 ). The patient was diagnosed with right‐sided testicular cancer, para‐aortic lymph node metastasis, and T1N1M0, and right high orchiectomy was performed. Pathology revealed a mixed germ cell tumor including yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, teratoma, and choriocarcinoma (Figure  2 ). Postoperative tumor markers were: AFP, 593.1 ng/mL; HCG, 1.4 mIU/mL. The patient was initially scheduled to undergo three cycles of BEP therapy, with each cycle lasting 3 weeks. The regimen consists of bleomycin (30 mg per course), etoposide (180 mg per day for 5 days per course), and cisplatin (37 mg per day for 5 days per course). The decrease in AFP during chemotherapy was slightly poorer than the decrease in half‐life (approximately 5 days). (Figure  3 ) He received one additional cycle of BEP chemotherapy, bringing the total to four cycles. Thus, we examined the patient for residual disease. Although CT showed no new metastases, whole‐body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a high‐signal diffusion‐weighted imaging nodule on the left side of the sacrum, highly suggestive of bone metastases (Figure  4 ). MRI of the spine was then performed for the identification of the site of metastasis. Solitary bone metastasis to the left sacrum was diagnosed, and stereotactic radiotherapy of 36.8 Gy/8f was administered to the same area. CT findings.

        "content": "Bone metastasis from a germ cell tumor is rare, but the associated prognosis is poor [ 2 ,  3 ]. Furthermore, patients with isolated bone metastases at the time of initial diagnosis are extremely rare. Most reported metastatic cases involved nonseminomas originating from the testis [ 4 ]. The present case was also a mixed germ cell tumor, and metastasis was considered to have already occurred at the time of initial diagnosis, but the metastatic site could not be detected by CT, a standard imaging test. Whole‐body MRI revealed a high‐signal diffusion‐weighted imaging nodule on the left side of the sacrum, highly suggestive of bone metastases. The diagnostic radiologists and the radiation oncologist identified the nodular lesion in the left sacrum as a metastatic bone lesion on the basis of the MRI findings. Given that the patient was undergoing chemotherapy for metastatic testicular cancer, it is reasonable to consider the sacral metastatic bone lesion as a metastasis from the testicular cancer. A tissue biopsy was not performed, as it was deemed too invasive to reliably obtain tissue from the bone metastasis site. Furthermore, removal of the metastatic site was not conducted because it was considered overly invasive and would likely diminish the patient's quality of life. Stereotactic radiotherapy was administered, as it was anticipated to effectively treat the sacral metastasis without adversely affecting the patient's quality of life. The AFP half‐life indicates the rate at which tumor markers decrease [ 5 ,  6 ]. It is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of early treatment. The time to normalization of markers can be used to predict the period until marker values reach their normal range, which is useful for determining treatment plans. These indices are widely used to adjust treatment and improve the prognosis [ 7 ]. In this case, the AFP half‐life was consistent with the estimated rate of tumor marker decrease. The time to marker normalization was also consistent with the estimated time period. At the time of radiotherapy, the AFP levels had normalized. If MRI had not been performed, the residual lesion would not have been detected. Thus, the patient would have experienced recurrence at a later date and required secondary chemotherapy. This patient was classified as belonging to the good prognosis group according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification (IGCCC) [ 8 ]. We initially planned to administer three cycles of BEP therapy; however, we observed that the rate of decline in AFP did not align with the expected half‐life. Consequently, we discussed this with the patient, engaged in shared decision‐making, and opted to administer four cycles of BEP therapy. Additionally, since the patient experienced minimal side effects during treatment, we administered the standard dosage of bleomycin for the fourth cycle, despite the patient being somewhat older at 42 years of age. Imaging evaluation following chemotherapy is crucial; however, CT, a standard imaging test, has limitations, including low detection sensitivity. Regarding [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG‐PET) evaluation after chemotherapy for nonseminoma, a prospective multicenter collaborative study was conducted in 2008, the results were histologically confirmed in all cases, and the use of FDG‐PET is not recommended in guidelines [ 9 ]. In this case, whole‐body MRI revealed a high‐signal diffusion‐weighted imaging nodule on the left side of the sacrum. There are few reports of whole‐body MRI when diagnosing metastatic sites in patients with germ cell tumors [ 10 ]. For prostate cancer, MET‐RADS‐P (METastasis Reporting and Data System), a structured reporting system for the assessment of bone metastases in prostate cancer published by the European Association of Urology in 2017, recommends whole‐body MRI for bone metastases and castration‐resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) without distant metastases [ 11 ]. The evaluation of whole‐body MRI for conditions other than bone metastases has yet to be established, but because it offers several advantages, including the absence of radiation exposure, the elimination of contrast agents, and the ability to scan the entire body in a single session, and as more evidence accumulates, it is likely to become a valuable method for staging and monitoring the progression of germ cell tumors, particularly beneficial for follow‐up assessments after the treatment of testicular cancer, which is common among relatively young patients. Furthermore, we are of the opinion that for patients in whom residual disease is suspected on the basis of whole‐body MRI, the addition of regional MRI, as demonstrated in the present case, can increase diagnostic certainty. Historically, nonseminomatous germ cell tumors have been considered a radioresistant disease [ 12 ]. Considering the significant advancements in radiotherapy technology, which have enhanced precision in treatment delivery and facilitated dose escalation while reducing treatment‐related morbidity, platinum‐refractory disease and consolidation therapy for residual masses following systemic therapy for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors may represent crucial areas of focus in radiotherapy."

    "title": "Exploration of the treatment challenges in men with intellectual difficulties and testicular cancer as seen in Down syndrome: single centre experience",
    "abstract": "Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder in humans as well as the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability. A spectrum of physical and functional disability is associated with the syndrome as well as a predisposition to developing particular malignancies, including testicular cancers. These tumours ordinarily have a high cure rate even in widely disseminated disease. However, individuals with Down syndrome may have learning difficulties, behavioural problems, and multiple systemic complications that have the potential to make standard treatment more risky and necessitates individualized approach in order to avoid unacceptable harm. There is also suggestion that tumours may have a different natural history. Further, people with learning disabilities have often experienced poorer healthcare than the general population. In order to address these inequalities, legislation, professional bodies, and charities provide guidance; however, ultimately, consideration of the person in the context of their own psychosocial issues, comorbidities, and possible treatment strategies is vital in delivering optimal care. We aim to present a review of our own experience of delivering individualized care to this group of patients in order to close the existing health inequality gap.",

        "content": "Germ cell tumours make up 95 % of malignant tumours of the testes. Although rare (constituting 2 % of all human malignancies), they are the most common solid tumours in young men between the ages of 15 and 44 years [ 1 ]. Sensitivity to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy lends itself to excellent cure rates, even in the metastatic setting, with 10-year survival of 96 % across all stages [ 1 ]. Deviation from standard care can significantly compromise outcomes [ 1 ]. Further, the predisposition to testicular cancer in those with Down syndrome raises particular challenges with respect to this [ 3 ,  12 ]. The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust acts as a supraregional centre and manages all advanced germ cell tumours or cases requiring complex surgical or medical management for a population of 5.6 million people in South East England, seeing over 100 new patients a year. We have previously presented our case series of Down syndrome and testicular germ cell tumours over a 20-year period [ 2 ]. Here, we aim to review the considerations necessary when treating this group of patients and present important aspects to support individual physical and psychological needs to deliver best care from diagnosis to treatment and subsequent long-term follow-up."

        "section_name": "Methods",
        "content": "A search was made of our personal referencing archives relating to the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of testicular germ cell cancers and Down syndrome. The Cochrane Database was also interrogated for systematic reviews or meta-analyses. We also reviewed guidelines published by the European Society of Medical Oncology, the European Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group, and national and international public health bodies regarding best care of those with learning or intellectual disability. This paper reflects expert opinion and current literature accessed by the authors; no other formal search strategy has been defined. Down syndrome is the most common and best-known chromosomal disorder in humans; 95 % of cases are due to trisomy of chromosome 21. This genetic imbalance gives rise to multiple systemic complications, including increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, congenital cardiac abnormality (up to 60 % of children), gastrointestinal abnormalities such as gastro-intestinal atresia and Hirschsprung’s disease, orthopaedic complications, thyroid disorders, hearing and visual impairment, and urological abnormalities including hypospadias, cryptorchidism (up to 27 % of males), and renal malformations (3.5 %) [ 3 ,  4 ]. There is also a predisposition to other cancers, including leukaemia, of which there is a 10- to 20-fold increased risk [ 5 ,  6 ]. Down syndrome is also the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and accounts for one third of all moderate and severe learning difficulties in children [ 7 ]. Almost all individuals with Down syndrome demonstrate some degree of cognitive impairment. The spectrum of deficit is wide; most have an IQ in the 50 to 70 or 35 to 50 range, consistent with mild to moderate intellectual disability respectively, whereas some have severe impairment with an IQ in the 20 to 35 range [ 8 ]. Cognitive function is also affected by early onset dementia, with Alzheimer-like changes evident in >50 % of those over the age of 35 years [ 4 ,  9 ]. Compared to the general population, they experience greater neurophysical morbidity, including epilepsy, autism, behavioural difficulties, and mood disorders [ 4 ]. As a result, individuals are less likely to recognise or communicate that they are experiencing a problem. Although the phenotypic manifestation of Down syndrome varies between individuals, the combination of learning disability and co-morbidity can often lead to non-standard treatment for many disorders. Given testicular cancer has a high cure rate even in the presence of metastatic disease, the risk of non-standard oncological treatment for those with Down syndrome raises the likelihood of treatment failure [ 1 ]. These tumours may also have an altered natural history that may in turn effect cure [ 10 – 12 ]. It can be hypothesized that the cytogenetic aberrations seen in Down syndrome could lead to altered biological features in germ cell tumours; this possibility is exemplified in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The immunophenotypic and biological features of ALL in those with Down syndrome are distinctly different from those without [ 13 ]. When outcomes of ALL in 653 children with Down syndrome enrolled in 16 international trials from 1995 to 2004 were examined and compared to 4445 children with ALL and no Down syndrome, it was found that Down syndrome-associated ALL had a significantly higher 8-year cumulative incidence of relapse (26 % vs 15 %), poorer event-free 8-year survival (64 % vs 81 %), and inferior overall survival at 8 years (74 % vs 89 %). In addition, they experienced significantly worse treatment-related mortality independent of therapeutic regime (7 % vs 2 %), with the most common cause of death resulting from infection [ 14 ]. The small sample size of reported Down syndrome and testicular cancer series has precluded definitive conclusions to be drawn regarding similar outcome parameters [ 2 ,  15 ]. Testicular germ cell cancers affect mainly young men, with 85 % presenting between 15 and 44 years of age [ 1 ]. Germ cell tumours are classified as pure seminomas or non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, which include variants such as embryonal carcinoma, teratocarcinoma, yolk sac tumour, choriocarcinoma, and teratoma [ 16 ]. The incidence of pure seminomas peaks in men aged 30 to 45 years, whereas non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCTs) peak in men aged 20 to 35 years [ 17 ]. In Down syndrome, most testicular tumours are seminomas irrespective of age [ 15 ]. Although there is global variation, the incidence of testicular germ cell tumours in the general population of Western Europe is 0.09 % compared to 0.5 % in those with Down syndrome [ 12 ,  15 ,  18 ,  19 ]. The exact biological mechanism for this predisposition is unknown. Contributing factors are thought to include cryptorchidism, high levels of gonadotropins especially follicle-stimulating hormone, an oncogenic gene dose effect due to the extra genetic material present, delayed germ cell maturation in the fetus, increased sensitivity of trisomic cells to carcinogens, or germ cell oncogenesis in utero occurring with increased maternal age [ 4 ,  5 ,  12 ,  20 – 22 ]. Ordinarily, more than 95 % of men with testicular cancer will present to the urologist with a lump in testis that is often painless [ 23 ]. In patients with Down syndrome, diagnosis is usually as a result of an incidental finding. More than half of the cases are detected during in-patient hospital treatment for other causes, or by the primary care giver, with self-reporting least likely to lead to diagnosis [ 2 ]. To improve patient awareness and guide self-examination a number of easy-read picture booklets have been produced. In view of the potential communication issues, increased vigilance for those providing routine clinical care to those with Down syndrome should be encouraged with testicular examination performed where appropriate during routine health checks [ 4 ]. In view of difficulties in self-reporting, it is often assumed that these tumours present later and at a more advanced stage. However, there is no data to support this, and stage of presentation is often comparable with that of the general population [ 12 ,  24 ]. People with learning disabilities often experience poorer healthcare than the general population and significant failings have been identified [ 25 ]. In response to this, key reports (in the UK) have been commissioned to bring about change to the way care is delivered and outline what reasonable adjustments need to be made in order to ensure there is equity [ 26 – 28 ]. As is the case throughout the world, legislation is often needed to ensure these rights are maintained. Important legislation in the UK includes the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, and the Human Rights Act 1998, all of which inform the work of professionals caring for those with learning difficulties [ 29 ,  30 ]. The Mental Capacity Act, in particular, covers a number of important aspects, including introducing an independent Mental Capacity Advocate Service and establishing a code of practice and a framework for delivering care to those who may lack capacity [ 31 ]. The degree of learning difficulties exhibited in our previously reported patient group meant no individual had the capacity to give informed consent about their care and therefore a decision based on the patients’ best interest was made [ 2 ]. Best interest decisions are guided by what the individual wants, the appointed advocate, and by listening to those who know and care for the individual. In the absence of a best interest consensus, in the UK, a judicial decision would then be made by the Court of Protection [ 31 ]. The Mental Capacity Act also clarifies on the legality of enrolling individuals in certain closely regulated medical research. Enrolment in trials is permitted with strict safeguards to ensure that the research is expected to benefit the individual directly and that the risks are not excessive in relation to the anticipated benefits. Before enrolment, researchers must also identify somebody close to the individual or, in their absence, someone independent to the researchers who is willing to be consulted about the appropriateness of their involvement [ 31 ]. Non-governmental organizations are also an important resource for healthcare professionals to guide patient-centred care. The UK charity for those with learning disability,  Mencap , has recommended key issues to ensure best practice is maintained [ 32 ], including longer appointment times, communication with the individual (verbal and non-verbal), listening to the knowledge of families and carers, and valuing the life of the person with a learning disability. Poor communication in many instances has led to shortcomings in care delivery [ 25 ]. However, there are many ways in which communication can be aided and information made more accessible, including easy-read information, picture guides, and individualised health plans. Many institutions also have a variation on the ‘patient passport’, which ensures that during their care, patients are presented as individuals and not merely as a sum of their diagnoses. It contains information on particular likes, dislikes, and needs in order to facilitate successful interactions [ 32 ,  33 ]. It is also important to recognise that those with profound and multiple learning disabilities may not communicate formally with speech or pictures but use facial expressions, vocal sounds, and body language. There are different techniques that can be used to help interpret their needs in order to facilitate care. Often, those who support and care for these individuals have spent time getting to know their means of communication and have found effective personal means of interaction and are therefore an important resource [ 32 ]. There are many complex issues facing people with learning difficulties and their access to healthcare, but central to almost all failings is often the lack of value placed on the life of someone with a learning disability [ 25 ,  34 ]. A number of specific factors and systematic shortcomings have been identified [ 35 ,  36 ]. The Confidential Injury into Premature Deaths of People with Intellectual Disabilities (CIPOLD) investigated all known events leading to the death of 247 people with intellectual disability over a 2-year period. The causes identified in a subset of those with intellectual disabilities included problems with advanced care planning, adherence to the Mental Capacity Act, inappropriate accommodation, not adjusting care as needs changed, and carers not feeling listened to [ 37 ]. In addition, they experienced significantly more problems with diagnosis and treatment, as well as with all other aspects of care provision, planning, coordination, and documentation. Alarmingly, 37 % of all deaths of people with intellectual disabilities were found to be avoidable and from causes that were potentially amenable to change by better quality healthcare [ 37 ]. The presence of discrimination, abuse, and neglect across the range of health services is well documented and we would recommend review of these reports to ensure that any intentional or unintentional negative assumptions are guarded against in order to prevent avoidable harm [ 34 ,  35 ,  37 ]. General staff training to improve understanding and awareness of reasonable adjustments and patient needs will help improve patient safety and outcomes [ 35 ]. At the time of initial presentation most men presenting with testicular cancer undergo a radical inguinal orchidectomy for both diagnosis and definitive treatment. For men presenting with advanced disease, radical orchidectomy is preferred prior to chemotherapy where possible except in circumstances of life threatening advanced disease when pathological diagnosis is made from metastatic lesion biopsy and orchidectomy may be delayed until after the completion of chemotherapy. The pathology informs treatment stratification as seminomas and NSGCT differ in biology. In general, seminomas are less likely to metastasise to viscera (men commonly present with localised disease – 80 % will have stage I disease at presentation), they are more sensitive to radiotherapy treatment than NSGCTs, and are not usually associated with elevated serum tumour markers (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha fetoprotein) [ 1 ]. An overview of the standard management of testicular germ cell tumours in the general population can be found through a number of sources [ 1 ,  38 ]. We have previously reported on the medical management of patients with histologically confirmed testicular cancer and Down syndrome treated at the Royal Marsden Foundation Trust between 1982 and 2005 and found that their known comorbidities has an impact on conventional treatment delivery [ 2 ]. Prior to starting therapy, ordinarily cryopreservation is made available to all men diagnosed with testicular cancer should they wish to preserve fertility [ 1 ]. Almost all men with Down syndrome are infertile because of impaired spermatogenesis [ 39 ]. There have, however, been reported cases of live births fathered by men with Down syndrome [ 40 ]. Given that the impact of Down syndrome on each person is variable, with some able to live independently as adults, assumptions and expectations about fertility should be explored on a case-by-case basis. In general, stage I seminoma can be managed with surveillance following orchidectomy with an anticipated relapse rate of 18 % [ 41 ]. Surveillance would be our general population-based recommendation for those with one or no risk factors for relapse, as most will be successfully treated with no adverse impact on oncological outcome. It is reliant, however, on compliance and long-term commitment to attend for regular follow-up as time to relapse can be prolonged [ 1 ]. The intra-abdominal nature and predominate marker negative status of relapsed disease requires regular cross sectional imaging [ 1 ]. The potential distress and emotional impact this may cause to those with Down syndrome and intellectual disabilities despite appropriate support should be judged individually. Alternatively, adjuvant carboplatin or radiotherapy can be considered in all patients who decline surveillance, reducing the risk of relapse to less than 5 % [ 42 – 44 ]. It is also considered in those who are less able to comply or commit to the regular follow-up surveillance requires. Adjuvant treatment is often considered in those with Down syndrome to spare more intense combination chemotherapy at disease relapse, which may be poorly tolerated. Despite this approach, relapse rates appear as high as 75 % in Down syndrome, still necessitating further combination chemotherapy [ 2 ]. Although the patient numbers are small, the high relapse rate despite adequate initial treatment supports previous evidence of altered tumour biology compared to the general population [ 12 ]. Following orchiectomy, the optimal treatment for stage II seminoma conventionally depends upon whether there is bulky lymph node involvement [ 1 ]. In low volume stage II seminoma, radiotherapy to the para-aortic and ipsilateral lymph node region is an option. We have combined initial single cycle carboplatin with subsequent lower dose radiotherapy to the para-aortic nodes alone to mitigate side effects and long-term toxicity with the larger radiation fields and higher dose as our conventional standard [ 45 ]. Multi-agent chemotherapy (BEP; bleomycin, etopside, and cisplatin) is used in bulkier and more advanced disease. However, deviation from standard combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy is often found to be necessary in those with Down syndrome to avoid potential significant toxicity [ 2 ]. In particular, substitution of cisplatin is made with carboplatin both because of renal impairment and in order to reduce fluid load in those with pre-existing cardiac malformations. Although 3 to 4 cycles of single agent carboplatin may appear attractive in terms of toxicity profile, it is associated with higher rates of failure and so should only be considered in circumstances where the risk of standard multi-agent chemotherapy significantly outweighs the benefit [ 46 ]. The expected relapse rate for stage II disease following standard therapy is 10 % [ 47 ]. In those with Down syndrome and stage II disease, treated with four cycles of carboplatin, more than 30 % of patients fail treatment (although death from disease remains rare) [ 2 ]. Despite drug modifications, patients are still likely to suffer chemotherapy toxicity. Over half of patients require hospital admission for complications on treatment, including sepsis, pulmonary oedema, and seizures [ 2 ]. This high failure rate and poor tolerance supports the hypothesis that unique biological factors affect treatment outcome, as is seen in those with ALL [ 14 ,  48 ]. Therefore, given the poor tolerance of chemotherapy, in stage IIa/IIb seminoma, radiotherapy should be considered an important alternative radical treatment option [ 16 ,  49 ]. NSGCTs are less common in those with Down syndrome than the general testicular cancer patient population. In stage I disease conventionally following orchidectomy 30 % of all men will relapse with recurrent disease and 50 % will relapse if lymphovascular invasion was present on pathology [ 1 ]. The majority (95 %) of these relapses will occur within the first 2 years; on relapse, cure is close to 100 % with chemotherapy [ 1 ,  50 ]. Therefore, although surveillance following orchiectomy is acceptable in the general population, the individual appropriateness of an intense surveillance protocol should be judged and discussed with the patient and carers in Down syndrome as poor adherence to surveillance could mean potential recurrence at advanced stage disease necessitating more chemotherapy than would have been required in the adjuvant setting. The efficacy of two cycles of adjuvant BEP is established in routine care, but there is accumulating evidence that a single cycle maybe equally as effective and so may be preferable when poor tolerance of chemotherapy is anticipated [ 50 ,  51 ]. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection may also be an option in the adjuvant setting in those unsafe/unsuitable for chemotherapy, although it is known to be inferior to one cycle of BEP [ 51 ]. In the metastatic setting, three or four cycles of BEP chemotherapy would be considered standard depending on the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group risk classification, but careful assessment of fitness for safe administration of this regime would be required [ 1 ]. We have found that learning disability in itself does not and should not preclude radical therapy. However, in the presence of moderate and severe learning disabilities, general anaesthetic is occasionally necessary in order to aid compliance to investigations, complete diagnostic staging, and safely deliver radiotherapy. Importantly, due to the known behavioural disorders, lack of cooperation should not be assumed to be necessarily associated with a lack of consent and other factors, including distress, should be considered. A cancer diagnosis can lead to psychological distress in up to 75 % of cases in the general cancer patient population [ 52 ]. In view of this, current UK government policy recommends that all patients should undergo systematic psychological assessment at key points during their cancer journey complimented by access to appropriate psychological support services. There is, however, a lack of clarity about the most effective way to address this psychological distress. Nurse-delivered interventions combining information with supportive attention may have a beneficial impact on mood in an undifferentiated population of newly diagnosed cancer patients [ 52 ]. A randomized control trial has shown no evidence of benefit for routine psychological therapy in newly diagnosed patients with testicular cancer [ 53 ]. However, in line with Moynihan et al. [ 53 ], we would suggest that, although specific interventions must be systematically evaluated, informing and reassuring patients should be seen as an integral part of routine care. Behavioural and psychiatric disorders are common in Down syndrome, with an estimated 22 % of individuals affected (18 % under the age of 20) [ 4 ,  54 ]. The most common manifestation is usually disruptive, aggressive and repetitive behaviours, anxiety disorders, and major depressive illnesses [ 54 ]. This pre-existing psychological distress can be exacerbated by the diagnosis of testicular cancer and the change in usual environment and routine that subsequent treatment entails. Deterioration in family social interaction as a result of repeated hospitalisation due to both chemotherapy and the complications arising from it is seen [ 2 ], highlighting the importance of recognising worsening mental health problems and offering appropriate support to deliver holistic care. The successful management of germ cell tumours in the general population has meant that emphasis is now on minimising treatment-related toxicity, ensuring appropriate follow-up mechanisms are in place to detect relapse, addressing long term treatment side effects, and effective rehabilitation. These survivorship aims are now also increasingly pertinent to those with Down syndrome given survival in Down syndrome has improved substantially in recent years and is approaching that of the general population, owed predominantly to improved management of congenital cardiac abnormalities [ 55 ]. Death from cancer in Down syndrome remains rare. The most common contributing causes of death are usually pneumonias, other infections, congenital malformations, circulatory disease, and dementia [ 56 ,  57 ]. The young age at presentation and high cure rates of testicular cancer in the general population, mean that it becomes increasingly important to recognise and minimise long-term treatment toxicity. The most common potentially life-threatening late effects, usually occurring more than 10 years after treatment, are second malignancy and cardiovascular disease [ 58 ,  59 ]. Other long-term effects include pulmonary toxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, decreased fertility, hypogonadism, and psychosocial problems [ 58 ]. Given the improved survival, similar consideration should also be made to the long-term health consequences in Down syndrome testicular cancer survivors. Individuals with Down syndrome have a reduced resting metabolic rate, which contributes to higher rates of obesity [ 4 ,  60 ]. This predisposition further increases the likelihood of metabolic syndrome, which has been shown to be higher after testicular cancer treatment and may be a significant contributing factor in the development of cardiovascular disease following treatment [ 61 ]."

        "content": "Down syndrome is the most common and best-known chromosomal disorder in humans; 95 % of cases are due to trisomy of chromosome 21. This genetic imbalance gives rise to multiple systemic complications, including increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, congenital cardiac abnormality (up to 60 % of children), gastrointestinal abnormalities such as gastro-intestinal atresia and Hirschsprung’s disease, orthopaedic complications, thyroid disorders, hearing and visual impairment, and urological abnormalities including hypospadias, cryptorchidism (up to 27 % of males), and renal malformations (3.5 %) [ 3 ,  4 ]. There is also a predisposition to other cancers, including leukaemia, of which there is a 10- to 20-fold increased risk [ 5 ,  6 ]. Down syndrome is also the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and accounts for one third of all moderate and severe learning difficulties in children [ 7 ]. Almost all individuals with Down syndrome demonstrate some degree of cognitive impairment. The spectrum of deficit is wide; most have an IQ in the 50 to 70 or 35 to 50 range, consistent with mild to moderate intellectual disability respectively, whereas some have severe impairment with an IQ in the 20 to 35 range [ 8 ]. Cognitive function is also affected by early onset dementia, with Alzheimer-like changes evident in >50 % of those over the age of 35 years [ 4 ,  9 ]. Compared to the general population, they experience greater neurophysical morbidity, including epilepsy, autism, behavioural difficulties, and mood disorders [ 4 ]. As a result, individuals are less likely to recognise or communicate that they are experiencing a problem. Although the phenotypic manifestation of Down syndrome varies between individuals, the combination of learning disability and co-morbidity can often lead to non-standard treatment for many disorders. Given testicular cancer has a high cure rate even in the presence of metastatic disease, the risk of non-standard oncological treatment for those with Down syndrome raises the likelihood of treatment failure [ 1 ]. These tumours may also have an altered natural history that may in turn effect cure [ 10 – 12 ]. It can be hypothesized that the cytogenetic aberrations seen in Down syndrome could lead to altered biological features in germ cell tumours; this possibility is exemplified in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The immunophenotypic and biological features of ALL in those with Down syndrome are distinctly different from those without [ 13 ]. When outcomes of ALL in 653 children with Down syndrome enrolled in 16 international trials from 1995 to 2004 were examined and compared to 4445 children with ALL and no Down syndrome, it was found that Down syndrome-associated ALL had a significantly higher 8-year cumulative incidence of relapse (26 % vs 15 %), poorer event-free 8-year survival (64 % vs 81 %), and inferior overall survival at 8 years (74 % vs 89 %). In addition, they experienced significantly worse treatment-related mortality independent of therapeutic regime (7 % vs 2 %), with the most common cause of death resulting from infection [ 14 ]. The small sample size of reported Down syndrome and testicular cancer series has precluded definitive conclusions to be drawn regarding similar outcome parameters [ 2 ,  15 ]."

        "content": "Testicular germ cell cancers affect mainly young men, with 85 % presenting between 15 and 44 years of age [ 1 ]. Germ cell tumours are classified as pure seminomas or non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, which include variants such as embryonal carcinoma, teratocarcinoma, yolk sac tumour, choriocarcinoma, and teratoma [ 16 ]. The incidence of pure seminomas peaks in men aged 30 to 45 years, whereas non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCTs) peak in men aged 20 to 35 years [ 17 ]. In Down syndrome, most testicular tumours are seminomas irrespective of age [ 15 ]. Although there is global variation, the incidence of testicular germ cell tumours in the general population of Western Europe is 0.09 % compared to 0.5 % in those with Down syndrome [ 12 ,  15 ,  18 ,  19 ]. The exact biological mechanism for this predisposition is unknown. Contributing factors are thought to include cryptorchidism, high levels of gonadotropins especially follicle-stimulating hormone, an oncogenic gene dose effect due to the extra genetic material present, delayed germ cell maturation in the fetus, increased sensitivity of trisomic cells to carcinogens, or germ cell oncogenesis in utero occurring with increased maternal age [ 4 ,  5 ,  12 ,  20 – 22 ]."

In patients with Down syndrome, diagnosis is usually as a result of an incidental finding. More than half of the cases are detected during in-patient hospital treatment for other causes, or by the primary care giver, with self-reporting least likely to lead to diagnosis [ 2 ]. To improve patient awareness and guide self-examination a number of easy-read picture booklets have been produced. In view of the potential communication issues, increased vigilance for those providing routine clinical care to those with Down syndrome should be encouraged with testicular examination performed where appropriate during routine health checks [ 4 ]. In view of difficulties in self-reporting, it is often assumed that these tumours present later and at a more advanced stage. However, there is no data to support this, and stage of presentation is often comparable with that of the general population [ 12 ,  24 ]."

        "content": "People with learning disabilities often experience poorer healthcare than the general population and significant failings have been identified [ 25 ]. In response to this, key reports (in the UK) have been commissioned to bring about change to the way care is delivered and outline what reasonable adjustments need to be made in order to ensure there is equity [ 26 – 28 ]. As is the case throughout the world, legislation is often needed to ensure these rights are maintained. Important legislation in the UK includes the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, and the Human Rights Act 1998, all of which inform the work of professionals caring for those with learning difficulties [ 29 ,  30 ]. The Mental Capacity Act, in particular, covers a number of important aspects, including introducing an independent Mental Capacity Advocate Service and establishing a code of practice and a framework for delivering care to those who may lack capacity [ 31 ]. The degree of learning difficulties exhibited in our previously reported patient group meant no individual had the capacity to give informed consent about their care and therefore a decision based on the patients’ best interest was made [ 2 ]. Best interest decisions are guided by what the individual wants, the appointed advocate, and by listening to those who know and care for the individual. In the absence of a best interest consensus, in the UK, a judicial decision would then be made by the Court of Protection [ 31 ]. The Mental Capacity Act also clarifies on the legality of enrolling individuals in certain closely regulated medical research. Enrolment in trials is permitted with strict safeguards to ensure that the research is expected to benefit the individual directly and that the risks are not excessive in relation to the anticipated benefits. Before enrolment, researchers must also identify somebody close to the individual or, in their absence, someone independent to the researchers who is willing to be consulted about the appropriateness of their involvement [ 31 ]. Non-governmental organizations are also an important resource for healthcare professionals to guide patient-centred care. The UK charity for those with learning disability,  Mencap , has recommended key issues to ensure best practice is maintained [ 32 ], including longer appointment times, communication with the individual (verbal and non-verbal), listening to the knowledge of families and carers, and valuing the life of the person with a learning disability. Poor communication in many instances has led to shortcomings in care delivery [ 25 ]. However, there are many ways in which communication can be aided and information made more accessible, including easy-read information, picture guides, and individualised health plans. Many institutions also have a variation on the ‘patient passport’, which ensures that during their care, patients are presented as individuals and not merely as a sum of their diagnoses. It contains information on particular likes, dislikes, and needs in order to facilitate successful interactions [ 32 ,  33 ]. It is also important to recognise that those with profound and multiple learning disabilities may not communicate formally with speech or pictures but use facial expressions, vocal sounds, and body language. There are different techniques that can be used to help interpret their needs in order to facilitate care. Often, those who support and care for these individuals have spent time getting to know their means of communication and have found effective personal means of interaction and are therefore an important resource [ 32 ]. There are many complex issues facing people with learning difficulties and their access to healthcare, but central to almost all failings is often the lack of value placed on the life of someone with a learning disability [ 25 ,  34 ]. A number of specific factors and systematic shortcomings have been identified [ 35 ,  36 ]. The Confidential Injury into Premature Deaths of People with Intellectual Disabilities (CIPOLD) investigated all known events leading to the death of 247 people with intellectual disability over a 2-year period. The causes identified in a subset of those with intellectual disabilities included problems with advanced care planning, adherence to the Mental Capacity Act, inappropriate accommodation, not adjusting care as needs changed, and carers not feeling listened to [ 37 ]. In addition, they experienced significantly more problems with diagnosis and treatment, as well as with all other aspects of care provision, planning, coordination, and documentation. Alarmingly, 37 % of all deaths of people with intellectual disabilities were found to be avoidable and from causes that were potentially amenable to change by better quality healthcare [ 37 ]. The presence of discrimination, abuse, and neglect across the range of health services is well documented and we would recommend review of these reports to ensure that any intentional or unintentional negative assumptions are guarded against in order to prevent avoidable harm [ 34 ,  35 ,  37 ]. General staff training to improve understanding and awareness of reasonable adjustments and patient needs will help improve patient safety and outcomes [ 35 ]."

        "content": "At the time of initial presentation most men presenting with testicular cancer undergo a radical inguinal orchidectomy for both diagnosis and definitive treatment. For men presenting with advanced disease, radical orchidectomy is preferred prior to chemotherapy where possible except in circumstances of life threatening advanced disease when pathological diagnosis is made from metastatic lesion biopsy and orchidectomy may be delayed until after the completion of chemotherapy. The pathology informs treatment stratification as seminomas and NSGCT differ in biology. In general, seminomas are less likely to metastasise to viscera (men commonly present with localised disease – 80 % will have stage I disease at presentation), they are more sensitive to radiotherapy treatment than NSGCTs, and are not usually associated with elevated serum tumour markers (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha fetoprotein) [ 1 ]. An overview of the standard management of testicular germ cell tumours in the general population can be found through a number of sources [ 1 ,  38 ]. We have previously reported on the medical management of patients with histologically confirmed testicular cancer and Down syndrome treated at the Royal Marsden Foundation Trust between 1982 and 2005 and found that their known comorbidities has an impact on conventional treatment delivery [ 2 ]. Prior to starting therapy, ordinarily cryopreservation is made available to all men diagnosed with testicular cancer should they wish to preserve fertility [ 1 ]. Almost all men with Down syndrome are infertile because of impaired spermatogenesis [ 39 ]. There have, however, been reported cases of live births fathered by men with Down syndrome [ 40 ]. Given that the impact of Down syndrome on each person is variable, with some able to live independently as adults, assumptions and expectations about fertility should be explored on a case-by-case basis."

        "section_name": "Management of seminoma and deviations from standard care",
        "content": "In general, stage I seminoma can be managed with surveillance following orchidectomy with an anticipated relapse rate of 18 % [ 41 ]. Surveillance would be our general population-based recommendation for those with one or no risk factors for relapse, as most will be successfully treated with no adverse impact on oncological outcome. It is reliant, however, on compliance and long-term commitment to attend for regular follow-up as time to relapse can be prolonged [ 1 ]. The intra-abdominal nature and predominate marker negative status of relapsed disease requires regular cross sectional imaging [ 1 ]. The potential distress and emotional impact this may cause to those with Down syndrome and intellectual disabilities despite appropriate support should be judged individually. Alternatively, adjuvant carboplatin or radiotherapy can be considered in all patients who decline surveillance, reducing the risk of relapse to less than 5 % [ 42 – 44 ]. It is also considered in those who are less able to comply or commit to the regular follow-up surveillance requires. Adjuvant treatment is often considered in those with Down syndrome to spare more intense combination chemotherapy at disease relapse, which may be poorly tolerated. Despite this approach, relapse rates appear as high as 75 % in Down syndrome, still necessitating further combination chemotherapy [ 2 ]. Although the patient numbers are small, the high relapse rate despite adequate initial treatment supports previous evidence of altered tumour biology compared to the general population [ 12 ]. Following orchiectomy, the optimal treatment for stage II seminoma conventionally depends upon whether there is bulky lymph node involvement [ 1 ]. In low volume stage II seminoma, radiotherapy to the para-aortic and ipsilateral lymph node region is an option. We have combined initial single cycle carboplatin with subsequent lower dose radiotherapy to the para-aortic nodes alone to mitigate side effects and long-term toxicity with the larger radiation fields and higher dose as our conventional standard [ 45 ]. Multi-agent chemotherapy (BEP; bleomycin, etopside, and cisplatin) is used in bulkier and more advanced disease. However, deviation from standard combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy is often found to be necessary in those with Down syndrome to avoid potential significant toxicity [ 2 ]. In particular, substitution of cisplatin is made with carboplatin both because of renal impairment and in order to reduce fluid load in those with pre-existing cardiac malformations. Although 3 to 4 cycles of single agent carboplatin may appear attractive in terms of toxicity profile, it is associated with higher rates of failure and so should only be considered in circumstances where the risk of standard multi-agent chemotherapy significantly outweighs the benefit [ 46 ]. The expected relapse rate for stage II disease following standard therapy is 10 % [ 47 ]. In those with Down syndrome and stage II disease, treated with four cycles of carboplatin, more than 30 % of patients fail treatment (although death from disease remains rare) [ 2 ]. Despite drug modifications, patients are still likely to suffer chemotherapy toxicity. Over half of patients require hospital admission for complications on treatment, including sepsis, pulmonary oedema, and seizures [ 2 ]. This high failure rate and poor tolerance supports the hypothesis that unique biological factors affect treatment outcome, as is seen in those with ALL [ 14 ,  48 ]. Therefore, given the poor tolerance of chemotherapy, in stage IIa/IIb seminoma, radiotherapy should be considered an important alternative radical treatment option [ 16 ,  49 ]."

        "content": "NSGCTs are less common in those with Down syndrome than the general testicular cancer patient population. In stage I disease conventionally following orchidectomy 30 % of all men will relapse with recurrent disease and 50 % will relapse if lymphovascular invasion was present on pathology [ 1 ]. The majority (95 %) of these relapses will occur within the first 2 years; on relapse, cure is close to 100 % with chemotherapy [ 1 ,  50 ]. Therefore, although surveillance following orchiectomy is acceptable in the general population, the individual appropriateness of an intense surveillance protocol should be judged and discussed with the patient and carers in Down syndrome as poor adherence to surveillance could mean potential recurrence at advanced stage disease necessitating more chemotherapy than would have been required in the adjuvant setting. The efficacy of two cycles of adjuvant BEP is established in routine care, but there is accumulating evidence that a single cycle maybe equally as effective and so may be preferable when poor tolerance of chemotherapy is anticipated [ 50 ,  51 ]. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection may also be an option in the adjuvant setting in those unsafe/unsuitable for chemotherapy, although it is known to be inferior to one cycle of BEP [ 51 ]. In the metastatic setting, three or four cycles of BEP chemotherapy would be considered standard depending on the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group risk classification, but careful assessment of fitness for safe administration of this regime would be required [ 1 ]. We have found that learning disability in itself does not and should not preclude radical therapy. However, in the presence of moderate and severe learning disabilities, general anaesthetic is occasionally necessary in order to aid compliance to investigations, complete diagnostic staging, and safely deliver radiotherapy. Importantly, due to the known behavioural disorders, lack of cooperation should not be assumed to be necessarily associated with a lack of consent and other factors, including distress, should be considered."

In view of this, current UK government policy recommends that all patients should undergo systematic psychological assessment at key points during their cancer journey complimented by access to appropriate psychological support services. There is, however, a lack of clarity about the most effective way to address this psychological distress. Nurse-delivered interventions combining information with supportive attention may have a beneficial impact on mood in an undifferentiated population of newly diagnosed cancer patients [ 52 ]. A randomized control trial has shown no evidence of benefit for routine psychological therapy in newly diagnosed patients with testicular cancer [ 53 ]. However, in line with Moynihan et al. [ 53 ], we would suggest that, although specific interventions must be systematically evaluated, informing and reassuring patients should be seen as an integral part of routine care. Behavioural and psychiatric disorders are common in Down syndrome, with an estimated 22 % of individuals affected (18 % under the age of 20) [ 4 ,  54 ]. The most common manifestation is usually disruptive, aggressive and repetitive behaviours, anxiety disorders, and major depressive illnesses [ 54 ]. This pre-existing psychological distress can be exacerbated by the diagnosis of testicular cancer and the change in usual environment and routine that subsequent treatment entails. Deterioration in family social interaction as a result of repeated hospitalisation due to both chemotherapy and the complications arising from it is seen [ 2 ], highlighting the importance of recognising worsening mental health problems and offering appropriate support to deliver holistic care."

The wide spectrum of comorbidities means an individualized approach is necessary and often requires modification of standard chemotherapy treatment in order to deliver safe care. Even when no deviation is made to standard care, there is suggestion of altered tumour biology and outcome compared to the general population that warrants further investigation. Despite this, a high cure rate can be achieved with appropriate therapy."

The age-adjusted incidence rate in the United States is 5.6 per 100,000 men per year based on data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program between 2007 to 2011. The SEER database tracks incidence and survival data from specific geographic areas representing 26% of the U.S. population. It is estimated that 8,820 new cases of testis cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2007, while only 380 (4%) patients died of their disease. The lifetime risk of developing testis cancer is approximately 0.4% with an estimated 227,406 men living with testis cancer in the U.S. as of 2007. Improved survival over the last thirty years is attributed to the development of cisplatin combination chemotherapy. A high cure rate coupled with the young age at diagnosis has resulted in a growing population of testicular cancer survivors. For unknown reasons, the incidence of GCT, particularly in Caucasian populations, is increasing globally. The lifetime risk of GCT’s in U.S. Caucasian men is estimated to be 1 in 230. In countries with the highest rate of GCTs, such as Demark, lifetime risk exceeds 1%. The SEER data indicates that between 1975 and 2004, the age-adjusted incidence rate of testicular cancer for males aged 15-49 years increased from 2.9 to 5.1 per 100,000 ( 2 ). This increase was more pronounced in seminoma compared to nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT). The trend appears to be influenced by a birth cohort effect, where people born in a specific time interval show different risk compared to the period immediately preceding or following. For example, men born in Denmark and Norway during World War II have a lower risk of testicular cancer than either previous or subsequent birth cohorts ( 3 ). Overall, rates of testicular cancer in industrialized nations are five times higher than those in less developed regions of the world. Further, considerable differences can be noted between neighboring countries and even within regions of the same country. For example, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland report age-standardized rates of roughly 9.5 per 100,000, while in Lithuania, Estonia, Spain and Latvia cancer incidence approaches 2 per 100,000 ( 4 ). Immigrant populations tend to carry the risk of their country of birth in the first generation, whereas, the risk of the second generation immigrants shifts toward the adopting population incidence ( 5 ). These observations coupled with the young age at presentation suggest an environmental risk factor acting in-utero or early in life. No specific etiological factors have yet been identified. The incidence of testicular cancer varies with respect to race with the highest rate in Caucasian populations. The U.S. incidence among white men historically has been five times that of African American men ( 4 ). Recently, rates of testicular cancer for African American ( 6 ) and Hispanic young adults ( 7 ) living in the U.S. appear to be increasing. In contrast, Pacific Islanders, Asian, American Indian and Alaskan Natives have an intermediate risk. The native Maori of New Zealand are an exception with one of the highest incidence of testicular cancer in the world, exceeding even the local white European population ( 8 ). Life expectancy of men beyond the second year post-diagnosis of testicular cancer is nearly identical to the general population ( 9 ); however, potential long-term risk exists for these patients. The contralateral testis may produce a second primary GCT in 2-5%. Late relapse of GCT affects approximately 3% of patients with NSGCT ( 10 ). Non-germ cell cancers are becoming an increasing problem following treatment of GCT. The 40-year cumulative incidence of a second malignant neoplasm may reach approximately one in three ( 11 ). In addition, survivors are at increased risk of developing delayed cardiovascular disease ( 12 ) as well as other treatment-related complications including neuropathy, nephro, oto, and pulmonary toxicity. Finally, sexual dysfunction and sub-fertility post treatment represent significant long-term morbidity in this young patient population ( 13 )."

Genetic syndromes linked to GCTs include Klinefelter syndrome which is associated with primary mediastinal GCT, and Down’s syndrome in which an increased rate of testicular seminoma is observed. It is estimated that 1.4% of men with newly diagnosed GCT have a positive family history. This rate exceeds the degree expected by chance alone. Sons of men with testicular GCT have a four- to six-fold increased risk, while siblings of men with testicular GCT have an increased risk of eight- to ten-fold ( 14 ). The International Testicular Cancer Linkage Consortium is collaboration between multiple centers that holds the largest database of familial GCT published to date. A total of 985 patients from 461 families have been studied thus far. Clinical and pathologic characteristics were similar to those generally described for non-familial cases. However, an increased prevalence of testicular microlithiasis on sonography was found in men with familial testicular cancer and their relatives ( 15 ). Unlike other hereditary cancers most GCT families consist of only two affected cases making genetic studies more difficult. Efforts are underway to find susceptibility genes for GCT within this unique group of familial cancers. Whether familial clusters of GCT are due to inherited mutations or simply reflect a shared environmental risk factor remains to be proven."

        "content": "In general, patients presenting with testicular cancer are divided into seminoma or nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT). Management is based on volume of disease assessed using radiological staging and tumor marker level after orchiectomy. In low volume disease the goal is to decrease treatment related morbidity while maintaining a high cure rate. In patients presenting with advanced disease, especially those belonging to the intermediate and poor risk category, the goal of treatment is to improve response to chemotherapy with acceptable patient morbidity. Seminoma represents approximately 60% of testicular GCTs. The incidence of testis tumors has risen over the last decade mostly due to seminomas ( 16 ). At presentation 80% of cases are stage I. Seminoma cases have a comparatively better prognosis than non-seminoma and stage III are very uncommon. Clinical research in GCT and seminoma in particular has led to a significant change in management. In the 1970’s and 1980’s treatment was based on radiation as this tumor is very radio-sensitive, however, the late effects of radiation and success of chemotherapy as curative treatment have changed the treatment algorithms. Currently, stage I patients are typically managed by surveillance alone, and stage II by a balance of radiation and chemotherapy. The main option is observation, where patients are followed by a careful schedule and treatment is opted for only in those who present with retroperitoneal or metastatic disease during follow-up ( 17 ). Outcome is excellent with almost 100% survival. Previously, radiation was given after diagnosis of stage I disease to prevent relapse. Most series published from single institutions reported very high survival rates and relapses were mainly outside of the radiation field—lungs, mediastinum and left supraclavicular fossa ( 18 , 19 ). The classical radiation fields followed areas of documented nodal involvement from surgical studies of modified retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) templates, on the right in the peri-caval and interaorto caval areas down to the common iliac vessels, and on the left, periaortic from the renal vessels to the bifurcation of the common iliac. The lower border on both sides is placed at a level roughly mid pelvis covering the common iliac nodes yet sparing the bladder and prostate ( 20 ). The most important prospective studies in this setting showed that 20 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions is ideal, though, carboplatin has an equivalent curing effect ( 21 , 22 ). The main side effects of radiation are sterility, cardiovascular disease and second malignancies ( 12 , 23 - 25 ). Shielding of the contralateral testis has a protective effect and large studies have shown that modern radiation fields do not hamper sperm counts in the long run ( 26 ). A large National Cancer Institute (NCI) study documented the chance of second malignancies to be twice as high as healthy counterparts ( 27 ). Surveillance of seminoma patients in stage I is now increasingly preformed. Disease relapse while on surveillance is seen in 15-20% ( 17 , 19 , 28 ), and is confined mainly to the retroperitoneum. Some groups tried to use a model based on high risk for relapse (primary testis tumor >4 cm and rete testis involvement) to direct management to radiation or carboplatin. Nonetheless, using this approach is not sufficiently accurate and 65% of patients may receive unnecessary treatment ( 29 ). Most relapses appear in the first 2 to 3 years after diagnosis ( 30 ). As such, the tendency would be for close follow up early on to identify relapse early in its course. In the past this entailed a CT scan every 2 months in the first year and every 3 months in the second year; a not insignificant radiation exposure. As expected, such intense imaging has been scrutinized due to the potential danger of secondary malignancies. Most current guidelines recommend CT scanning every 6 months for the first 2 to 3 years. Despite the heightened attention to cumulative radiation exposure, diagnosis of relapse at an earlier stage with a smaller size of nodal disease allows for cure by radiation alone, whereas a higher disease load or relapse outside of the retroperitoneum necessitates use of chemotherapy. Single agent carboplatin is the accepted alternative to radiation and surveillance ( 31 ). One or two cycles of carboplatin have reported relapse rates of 1.8-8.6% ( 17 ). The Medical Research Council (MRC) compared one cycle of carboplatin to adjuvant radiotherapy in nearly 1,500 patients. Updated results showed a 5-year relapse rate of 4% for radiotherapy and 5.3% for chemotherapy ( 32 ). Low volume retroperitoneal disease (i.e., less than 5 cm) may be cured by radiation. Large bulky disease or involvement of other organs is better treated by chemotherapy. Most cases may be cured by three courses of bleomycin, etoposide and cispatin (BEP) or four courses of EP. Rare cases of failure of primary chemo may be salvaged by local radiation or second line chemo therapy. Data accumulated in studies managing stage II seminoma show that for tumor size up to 5 cm radiation is an acceptable treatment modality with a 5-year relapse rate of up to 9%. Bulkier disease is best treated by chemotherapy with relapse rates of 6-13.5% ( 33 - 36 ). Recent studies as in SWENOTECA have shown the superiority of chemotherapy also in lower stages—seminoma IIa/b ( 37 ). The primary consideration for choice of therapy is chemotoxicity in older age patients where radiation may have fewer side effects. Radiation fields in this setting are similar to stage I, limiting pelvic radiation to the level of the acetabulum. A residual mass after radiation or chemotherapy is a unique challenge. In contrast to NSGCT post-chemotherapy residual disease where teratoma or cancer may be frequently found, most residual seminoma masses harbor fibrosis or necrosis. PET-CT may reliably indicate the presence of active tumor; therefore a negative PET-CT may allow observation even in large redial masses. Some centers advocate resection of all masses larger than 3 cm ( 38 ), though, this may be a difficult undertaking due to the desmoplastic reaction and adherence to the main blood vessels. Clinical stage I accounts for 50-60% of non-seminomatous testicular tumors. It is long known that the risk of occult metastatic disease (not identified on imaging) is dependent on the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in the tumor ( 39 - 41 ). LVI is present in about 30% of cases and the risk of recurrence is about 50% with LVI versus 15-20% without LVI ( 42 , 43 ). Another less accepted risk factor is embryonal predominance, with controversial data among different studies ( 41 - 43 ). Recurrences occur most commonly in the retroperitoneum, with the majority diagnosed within 2 years of orchiectomy ( 42 , 44 ). Management options for CSI NSGCT include surveillance, RPLND, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The rationale for surveillance among patients with CSI NSGCT is that studies have shown that approximately one in four patients will recur and require salvage treatment ( 39 - 41 ). This is the group that actually would benefit from adjuvant therapy, whereas most patients will not benefit. Active surveillance became an option in the 1980’s when Read  et al.  demonstrated that cisplatin-based chemotherapy could cure almost all recurrences ( 45 ). When studies revealed the importance of LVI as a prognostic factor for recurrence, risk-adapted approaches with surveillance or adjuvant treatment were implemented ( 46 , 47 ). At present, some centers advocate surveillance for all CSI NSGCT, consequently no patient will be treated unnecessarily; however, 50% of those with LVI and 15% of the patients without LVI will later need salvage treatment ( 41 , 46 , 47 ). Although not frequently used today, the advantage of RPLND is that it represents both a diagnostic and a therapeutic procedure. RPLND remains the most accurate means of staging patients with CSI NSGCT; roughly 50% to 70% will be pathologic stage I. In these patients, RPLND is purely diagnostic with the added benefit of a simpler follow up. Because retroperitoneal recurrence is rare with properly performed RPLND, abdominal CT scan may be omitted after negative RPLND. In the case of pathologic stage II disease RPLND is curative in 50% to 90% of patients, thus selected patients may avoid adjuvant chemotherapy ( 24 , 48 ). As noted previously, 50% of LVI positive patients will relapse, therefore adjuvant treatment would spare half of this group from a recurrence requiring three to four courses of chemotherapy and possibly post-chemotherapy surgery (PCS) for a residual tumor. Conversely, the other half would receive adjuvant chemotherapy ‘unnecessarily’. The main argument against adjuvant chemotherapy is its lack of improved overall survival and its association with long-term side effects including infertility, secondary malignancies, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease, impaired kidney function, hearing impairment, and peripheral neuropathy ( 48 - 50 ). One way to reduce toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy is to reduce the number of cycles used ( 51 , 52 ). The German testicular study group published data in 2008 from a randomized study on 382 patients with CSI NSGCT. Patients were randomized to RPLND (in the community) or BEP ×1 without regard to LVI. This was a non-inferiority study with a median follow-up of 4.7 years and a primary endpoint of recurrence rate. The recurrence rate was 1% and 7.9% for patients treated with BEP ×1 and RPLND, respectively. About 40% of each group were LVI-positive ( 53 ). The main criticism of this study is that RPLND was performed in less skilled hands as evidenced by unacceptably high in-field recurrence rates. SWENOTECA—the Swedish-Norwegian testicular cancer group now comprises all centers treating testicular cancer patients in Sweden and Norway. Based on the results from earlier treatment protocols a new risk-adapted treatment protocol for CSI NSGCT was initiated in 1995. During the period of 1995-1997, 232 patients were accrued to the SWENOTECA III protocol. CSI NSGCT LVI -  patients were randomized to cisplatin, vinblastin, bleomycin (CVB) ×1, or surveillance. LVI +  patients were treated with CVB ×2 and data was collected prospectively. The recurrence rate among the CVB ×1 patients was higher than expected and as such, the study was terminated early ( 54 ). SWENOTECA VI randomized low-risk patients (LVI - ) to surveillance or BEP ×1, and high-risk patients (LVI + ) to BEP ×2 or BEP ×1. Yearly assessments of the total cohort were performed and low relapse rates with BEP ×1 were noted. Accordingly, the protocol was amended to treat high-risk patients with BEP ×1. In 2009 results with a median follow-up of 4.7 years were reported. A total of 313 patients were treated with one course of adjuvant BEP (157 LVI + , 155 LVI –  and 1 LVI unknown). The relapse rate was 3.2% for LVI +  and 1.3% for LVI –  ( 47 ). Recently, the expanded data from a total of 517 patients (258 LVI + , 255 LVI –  and 4 LVI unknown) treated with one course of adjuvant BEP between 1998 and 2010 was reported ( 44 ). The median follow-up was 7.9 years. The data confirmed the SWENOTECAs earlier reported low relapse rates as well as excellent overall- and cause-specific survival. Only one patient died because of progressive cancer and there were no treatment related deaths. Five of the 12 relapses (42%) were cured by RPLND alone, and only 1.4% (7/517) of the patients actually required salvage chemotherapy. These findings confirm that one course of adjuvant BEP reduces the risk of relapse by 90-95% in all patients. No recurrences occurred later than 3.3 years post-treatment and as such, follow-up can safely be reduced to 5 years ( 55 ). The optimal treatment strategy for CSI NSGCT is controversial. To date, there are no randomized trials that demonstrate superiority of surveillance or adjuvant treatment. Further, cure approaches 100% regardless of treatment strategy. Thus the main issue is how to best minimize treatment related toxicity. As noted earlier, chemotherapy increases the risks of cardiovascular damage resulting in hypertension, cardiac events, and decreased kidney function. Impaired hearing, metabolic late effects, hypogonadism and increased risk for secondary cancers are also associated with adjuvant chemotherapy. As well, there is a clear dose-response relationship associated with increased cycles of chemotherapy. For stage I NSGCT, results from the SWENOTECA study show that adjuvant therapy can be safely reduced to just one course of BEP, resulting in a reduction in relapse rate of 90-95%. This lower dose of chemotherapy may mitigate many of the long-term consequences of therapy. In metastatic NSGCT, the degree of marker elevation before chemotherapy correlates with prognosis. The International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) has incorporated serum concentrations of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), AFP, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) into a prognostic classification system with high, intermediate, and low risk disease ( Table 1 ), and treatment is tailored according to the risk assignment. Systemic therapy for metastatic GCT consists of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. For good risk disease, the accepted standard is three courses of BEP or four courses of EP. Standard therapy for intermediate and poor risk disease remains four courses of BEP. NSGCT, nonseminomatous germ cell tumor; S1, a-fetoprotein (AFP) <1,000 ng/mL, and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) <5,000 mIU/mL, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) <1.5 upper limit of normal; S2, AFP =1,000-10,000 ng/mL, or hCG =5,000-50,000 mIU/mL, or LDH =1.5-10 upper limit of normal; S3, AFP >10,000 ng/mL, or hCG >50,000 mIU/mL, or LDH >10 upper limit of normal; RP, retroperitoneum; *, survival data for seminoma patients based on IGCCCG study ( 56 ). Survival for NSGCT patients is based on a more recent meta-analysis ( 57 ). Depending upon the patient population selected, roughly 70% of patients treated with first line chemotherapy will have complete radiographic and biochemical response. In the remaining 30% a residual mass will persist after chemotherapy, most commonly in the retroperitoneum ( 58 , 59 ). These patients will then undergo post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) because of possible residual teratoma (40%) or active cancer (10%) ( 60 ). The excision of all masses after chemotherapy, within and outside the boundaries of the retroperitoneum, is integral to the cure of NSGCT ( 61 ). It is well recognized that incomplete resection or surveillance of a residual mass after chemotherapy risks relapse ( 62 , 63 ). Therefore, any patient who has a mass larger than 1 cm in the retroperitoneum should undergo surgery. The proper extent of PCS resection and the need for PC-RPLND in patients achieving complete remission remains controversial ( 64 , 65 ). At most centers, the management of patients achieving a complete radiographic response to systemic chemotherapy is observation. However, studies have documented the incidence of residual teratoma in sub-centimeter retroperitoneal nodes following chemotherapy to be 20-30% ( 66 - 68 ). Therefore, some institutions have adopted a policy of PC-RPLND in all patients, including those achieving complete radiographic response. A study from Indiana University analyzed 141 consecutive patients who achieved complete remission following first-line induction chemotherapy ( 64 ). All patients were observed and did not undergo immediate PC-RPLND. Patients who had intermediate or poor prognosis disease constituted 23% of the cohort. After a median follow-up of 15.5 years, 12 patients experienced a relapse, of who four died of their disease. Amongst these four, the relapse occurred within the first year of chemotherapy; in two of them, the retroperitoneum was the site of relapse. Altogether, of the 141 patients, six (4%) relapses occurred in the retroperitoneum. The estimated 15-year cancer-specific survival rate was 97%. The data suggest that patients that relapse in the retroperitoneum on observation (4%) remain curable. It is unlikely that a different strategy could result in a higher 15 years cancer-specific survival. In other words, there is no evidence that immediate PC-RPLND would prevent those rare relapses in exchange for subjecting all patients to the morbidity of PC-RPLND. Two other North American studies similarly support the safety of observation ( 69 , 70 ). The current European and Canadian guidelines endorse this data and favor observation for patients achieving complete radiographic remission, whereas in the NCCN guidelines either immediate PC-RPLND or observation are appropriate. The second area of controversy is the extent of PC-RPLND. The extent of primary RPLND for stage I NSGCT has changed considerably over the last three decades from a full bilateral suprahilar dissection to a unilateral nerve sparring template without compromising cure. Unlike primary RPLND, in the management of post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal disease there has been no such reduction in surgical boundaries with full bilateral dissection considered standard therapy. In the 1970’s and 1980’s lower stage metastatic disease was more often treated with primary bilateral template RPLND in an attempt to avoid chemotherapy which had considerable morbidity at the time. With the improvement of antiemetic, growth factors and supportive care, the toxicity of chemotherapy has decreased. Today only select patients with limited retroperitoneal disease who have normalized serum tumor markers may be considered for primary RPLND ( 71 ). Patients with teratoma or non-germ cell component in their primary tumor can benefit the most from primary RPLND ( 72 ). Based on early experience from primary RPLND, retroperitoneal mapping studies have accurately documented the lymphatic spread of metastasis ( 73 , 74 ). Metastases right of the vena cava were rare in patients with a left-sided primary (3-7%), but crossover metastases left of the aorta were more common in patients with a right sided primary (8-19%). Theoretically, had chemotherapy been administered before surgery, it would not have changed the retroperitoneal distribution of the residual tumors, suggesting that template crossover after chemotherapy is not generally expected in low-stage left-sided tumors. Our group has shown from our experience with bilateral PC-RPLND that patients with left-sided primary tumors and clinical stage IIA or IIB disease at presentation did not have metastasis right of the aorta ( 75 ). In these patients it may be safe to perform a left modified dissection. Beck  et al.  ( 76 ) and Heidenreich  et al.  ( 77 ) have further shown that a modified unilateral PC-RPLND (either right or left) may be safe in select patients with low volume retroperitoneal disease (less than 5 cm), restricted to the primary landing zone of the affected testicle."

        "section_name": "Seminoma",
        "content": "Seminoma represents approximately 60% of testicular GCTs. The incidence of testis tumors has risen over the last decade mostly due to seminomas ( 16 ). At presentation 80% of cases are stage I. Seminoma cases have a comparatively better prognosis than non-seminoma and stage III are very uncommon. Clinical research in GCT and seminoma in particular has led to a significant change in management. In the 1970’s and 1980’s treatment was based on radiation as this tumor is very radio-sensitive, however, the late effects of radiation and success of chemotherapy as curative treatment have changed the treatment algorithms. Currently, stage I patients are typically managed by surveillance alone, and stage II by a balance of radiation and chemotherapy. The main option is observation, where patients are followed by a careful schedule and treatment is opted for only in those who present with retroperitoneal or metastatic disease during follow-up ( 17 ). Outcome is excellent with almost 100% survival. Previously, radiation was given after diagnosis of stage I disease to prevent relapse. Most series published from single institutions reported very high survival rates and relapses were mainly outside of the radiation field—lungs, mediastinum and left supraclavicular fossa ( 18 , 19 ). The classical radiation fields followed areas of documented nodal involvement from surgical studies of modified retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) templates, on the right in the peri-caval and interaorto caval areas down to the common iliac vessels, and on the left, periaortic from the renal vessels to the bifurcation of the common iliac. The lower border on both sides is placed at a level roughly mid pelvis covering the common iliac nodes yet sparing the bladder and prostate ( 20 ). The most important prospective studies in this setting showed that 20 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions is ideal, though, carboplatin has an equivalent curing effect ( 21 , 22 ). The main side effects of radiation are sterility, cardiovascular disease and second malignancies ( 12 , 23 - 25 ). Shielding of the contralateral testis has a protective effect and large studies have shown that modern radiation fields do not hamper sperm counts in the long run ( 26 ).

The German testicular study group published data in 2008 from a randomized study on 382 patients with CSI NSGCT. Patients were randomized to RPLND (in the community) or BEP ×1 without regard to LVI. This was a non-inferiority study with a median follow-up of 4.7 years and a primary endpoint of recurrence rate. The recurrence rate was 1% and 7.9% for patients treated with BEP ×1 and RPLND, respectively. About 40% of each group were LVI-positive ( 53 ). The main criticism of this study is that RPLND was performed in less skilled hands as evidenced by unacceptably high in-field recurrence rates. SWENOTECA—the Swedish-Norwegian testicular cancer group now comprises all centers treating testicular cancer patients in Sweden and Norway. Based on the results from earlier treatment protocols a new risk-adapted treatment protocol for CSI NSGCT was initiated in 1995. During the period of 1995-1997, 232 patients were accrued to the SWENOTECA III protocol. CSI NSGCT LVI -  patients were randomized to cisplatin, vinblastin, bleomycin (CVB) ×1, or surveillance. LVI +  patients were treated with CVB ×2 and data was collected prospectively. The recurrence rate among the CVB ×1 patients was higher than expected and as such, the study was terminated early ( 54 ). SWENOTECA VI randomized low-risk patients (LVI - ) to surveillance or BEP ×1, and high-risk patients (LVI + ) to BEP ×2 or BEP ×1. Yearly assessments of the total cohort were performed and low relapse rates with BEP ×1 were noted. Accordingly, the protocol was amended to treat high-risk patients with BEP ×1. In 2009 results with a median follow-up of 4.7 years were reported. A total of 313 patients were treated with one course of adjuvant BEP (157 LVI + , 155 LVI –  and 1 LVI unknown). The relapse rate was 3.2% for LVI +  and 1.3% for LVI –  ( 47 ). Recently, the expanded data from a total of 517 patients (258 LVI + , 255 LVI –  and 4 LVI unknown) treated with one course of adjuvant BEP between 1998 and 2010 was reported ( 44 ). The median follow-up was 7.9 years. The data confirmed the SWENOTECAs earlier reported low relapse rates as well as excellent overall- and cause-specific survival. Only one patient died because of progressive cancer and there were no treatment related deaths. Five of the 12 relapses (42%) were cured by RPLND alone, and only 1.4% (7/517) of the patients actually required salvage chemotherapy. These findings confirm that one course of adjuvant BEP reduces the risk of relapse by 90-95% in all patients. No recurrences occurred later than 3.3 years post-treatment and as such, follow-up can safely be reduced to 5 years ( 55 ). The optimal treatment strategy for CSI NSGCT is controversial. To date, there are no randomized trials that demonstrate superiority of surveillance or adjuvant treatment. Further, cure approaches 100% regardless of treatment strategy. Thus the main issue is how to best minimize treatment related toxicity. As noted earlier, chemotherapy increases the risks of cardiovascular damage resulting in hypertension, cardiac events, and decreased kidney function. Impaired hearing, metabolic late effects, hypogonadism and increased risk for secondary cancers are also associated with adjuvant chemotherapy. As well, there is a clear dose-response relationship associated with increased cycles of chemotherapy. For stage I NSGCT, results from the SWENOTECA study show that adjuvant therapy can be safely reduced to just one course of BEP, resulting in a reduction in relapse rate of 90-95%. This lower dose of chemotherapy may mitigate many of the long-term consequences of therapy. In metastatic NSGCT, the degree of marker elevation before chemotherapy correlates with prognosis. The International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) has incorporated serum concentrations of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), AFP, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) into a prognostic classification system with high, intermediate, and low risk disease ( Table 1 ), and treatment is tailored according to the risk assignment. Systemic therapy for metastatic GCT consists of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. For good risk disease, the accepted standard is three courses of BEP or four courses of EP. Standard therapy for intermediate and poor risk disease remains four courses of BEP. NSGCT, nonseminomatous germ cell tumor; S1, a-fetoprotein (AFP) <1,000 ng/mL, and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) <5,000 mIU/mL, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) <1.5 upper limit of normal; S2, AFP =1,000-10,000 ng/mL, or hCG =5,000-50,000 mIU/mL, or LDH =1.5-10 upper limit of normal; S3, AFP >10,000 ng/mL, or hCG >50,000 mIU/mL, or LDH >10 upper limit of normal; RP, retroperitoneum; *, survival data for seminoma patients based on IGCCCG study ( 56 ). Survival for NSGCT patients is based on a more recent meta-analysis ( 57 ). Depending upon the patient population selected, roughly 70% of patients treated with first line chemotherapy will have complete radiographic and biochemical response. In the remaining 30% a residual mass will persist after chemotherapy, most commonly in the retroperitoneum ( 58 , 59 ). These patients will then undergo post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) because of possible residual teratoma (40%) or active cancer (10%) ( 60 ). The excision of all masses after chemotherapy, within and outside the boundaries of the retroperitoneum, is integral to the cure of NSGCT ( 61 ). It is well recognized that incomplete resection or surveillance of a residual mass after chemotherapy risks relapse ( 62 , 63 ). Therefore, any patient who has a mass larger than 1 cm in the retroperitoneum should undergo surgery. The proper extent of PCS resection and the need for PC-RPLND in patients achieving complete remission remains controversial ( 64 , 65 ). At most centers, the management of patients achieving a complete radiographic response to systemic chemotherapy is observation. However, studies have documented the incidence of residual teratoma in sub-centimeter retroperitoneal nodes following chemotherapy to be 20-30% ( 66 - 68 ). Therefore, some institutions have adopted a policy of PC-RPLND in all patients, including those achieving complete radiographic response. A study from Indiana University analyzed 141 consecutive patients who achieved complete remission following first-line induction chemotherapy ( 64 ). All patients were observed and did not undergo immediate PC-RPLND. Patients who had intermediate or poor prognosis disease constituted 23% of the cohort. After a median follow-up of 15.5 years, 12 patients experienced a relapse, of who four died of their disease. Amongst these four, the relapse occurred within the first year of chemotherapy; in two of them, the retroperitoneum was the site of relapse. Altogether, of the 141 patients, six (4%) relapses occurred in the retroperitoneum. The estimated 15-year cancer-specific survival rate was 97%. The data suggest that patients that relapse in the retroperitoneum on observation (4%) remain curable. It is unlikely that a different strategy could result in a higher 15 years cancer-specific survival. In other words, there is no evidence that immediate PC-RPLND would prevent those rare relapses in exchange for subjecting all patients to the morbidity of PC-RPLND. Two other North American studies similarly support the safety of observation ( 69 , 70 ). The current European and Canadian guidelines endorse this data and favor observation for patients achieving complete radiographic remission, whereas in the NCCN guidelines either immediate PC-RPLND or observation are appropriate. The second area of controversy is the extent of PC-RPLND. The extent of primary RPLND for stage I NSGCT has changed considerably over the last three decades from a full bilateral suprahilar dissection to a unilateral nerve sparring template without compromising cure. Unlike primary RPLND, in the management of post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal disease there has been no such reduction in surgical boundaries with full bilateral dissection considered standard therapy. In the 1970’s and 1980’s lower stage metastatic disease was more often treated with primary bilateral template RPLND in an attempt to avoid chemotherapy which had considerable morbidity at the time. With the improvement of antiemetic, growth factors and supportive care, the toxicity of chemotherapy has decreased. Today only select patients with limited retroperitoneal disease who have normalized serum tumor markers may be considered for primary RPLND ( 71 ). Patients with teratoma or non-germ cell component in their primary tumor can benefit the most from primary RPLND ( 72 ). Based on early experience from primary RPLND, retroperitoneal mapping studies have accurately documented the lymphatic spread of metastasis ( 73 , 74 ). Metastases right of the vena cava were rare in patients with a left-sided primary (3-7%), but crossover metastases left of the aorta were more common in patients with a right sided primary (8-19%). Theoretically, had chemotherapy been administered before surgery, it would not have changed the retroperitoneal distribution of the residual tumors, suggesting that template crossover after chemotherapy is not generally expected in low-stage left-sided tumors. Our group has shown from our experience with bilateral PC-RPLND that patients with left-sided primary tumors and clinical stage IIA or IIB disease at presentation did not have metastasis right of the aorta ( 75 ). In these patients it may be safe to perform a left modified dissection. Beck  et al.  ( 76 ) and Heidenreich  et al.  ( 77 ) have further shown that a modified unilateral PC-RPLND (either right or left) may be safe in select patients with low volume retroperitoneal disease (less than 5 cm), restricted to the primary landing zone of the affected testicle."

        "content": "Clinical stage I accounts for 50-60% of non-seminomatous testicular tumors. It is long known that the risk of occult metastatic disease (not identified on imaging) is dependent on the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in the tumor ( 39 - 41 ). LVI is present in about 30% of cases and the risk of recurrence is about 50% with LVI versus 15-20% without LVI ( 42 , 43 ). Another less accepted risk factor is embryonal predominance, with controversial data among different studies ( 41 - 43 ). Recurrences occur most commonly in the retroperitoneum, with the majority diagnosed within 2 years of orchiectomy ( 42 , 44 ). Management options for CSI NSGCT include surveillance, RPLND, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The rationale for surveillance among patients with CSI NSGCT is that studies have shown that approximately one in four patients will recur and require salvage treatment ( 39 - 41 ). This is the group that actually would benefit from adjuvant therapy, whereas most patients will not benefit. Active surveillance became an option in the 1980’s when Read  et al.  demonstrated that cisplatin-based chemotherapy could cure almost all recurrences ( 45 ). When studies revealed the importance of LVI as a prognostic factor for recurrence, risk-adapted approaches with surveillance or adjuvant treatment were implemented ( 46 , 47 ). At present, some centers advocate surveillance for all CSI NSGCT, consequently no patient will be treated unnecessarily; however, 50% of those with LVI and 15% of the patients without LVI will later need salvage treatment ( 41 , 46 , 47 ). Although not frequently used today, the advantage of RPLND is that it represents both a diagnostic and a therapeutic procedure. RPLND remains the most accurate means of staging patients with CSI NSGCT; roughly 50% to 70% will be pathologic stage I. In these patients, RPLND is purely diagnostic with the added benefit of a simpler follow up. Because retroperitoneal recurrence is rare with properly performed RPLND, abdominal CT scan may be omitted after negative RPLND. In the case of pathologic stage II disease RPLND is curative in 50% to 90% of patients, thus selected patients may avoid adjuvant chemotherapy ( 24 , 48 ). As noted previously, 50% of LVI positive patients will relapse, therefore adjuvant treatment would spare half of this group from a recurrence requiring three to four courses of chemotherapy and possibly post-chemotherapy surgery (PCS) for a residual tumor. Conversely, the other half would receive adjuvant chemotherapy ‘unnecessarily’. The main argument against adjuvant chemotherapy is its lack of improved overall survival and its association with long-term side effects including infertility, secondary malignancies, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease, impaired kidney function, hearing impairment, and peripheral neuropathy ( 48 - 50 ).

    "title": "Long-term side effects of testicular cancer and treatment (observational study of mortality and morbidity in testicular cancer survivors)",
    "abstract": "Purpose Testicular cancer (TC) is a rare cancer, but due to early age at diagnosis and excellent cure rates, there is a large cohort of survivors. Recent studies have highlighted the late side effects of treatments of TC, especially cisplatin-based chemotherapy. These complications make the survivorship care challenging with detrimental effects on health and prognosis of TC survivors (TCS). In this study, we provide a snapshot of common late side effects in TCS and a possible care pathway with a nurse-led specialised clinic. Methods We invited TCS to participate in the study at one of the cancer centres in Ireland for a comprehensive screening using questionnaires, examination and blood tests. Further investigations were performed as indicated. Mortality was assessed through retrospective chart reviews. Results We recruited 78 TCS to participate in the study with a median of 129 months since diagnosis (range 60 to 304 months) and 3 who died in survivorship. Second malignant neoplasms accounted for all three mortalities. Most common conditions after 5 years of diagnosis were hypertension (40%), dyslipidaemia (55.6%), hypogonadism (~ 45%), and high BMI (52%). The majority of conditions were diagnosed during screening, including two cases of coronary artery disease and one case of transient ischaemic attacks. TCS who received chemotherapy and were aged more than 30 years at the time of diagnosis had a higher prevalence of the late side effects. Conclusions TC survivorship phase is marred by a range of late side effects. This remains a challenge for patients and healthcare workers as ambiguity surrounds the care pathways in the survivorship setting. We hope this nurse-led, specialised, screening clinic might improve the care and service provision for TC survivors.

        "content": "Testicular cancer (TC) is a rare solid organ tumour (1%) which usually occurs in the early years of life, most commonly between the ages of 18 to 39 years [ 1 ]. Recent studies have reported an increase in incidence with improvement in cure rates of TC in most developed countries including the US and North-Western Europe [ 2 ]. Therefore, we have a large cohort of TC survivors (TCS) increasing in size with each passing year. Although the cure rates are excellent, the treatment involves multiple modalities including high doses of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, surgical orchiectomy and radiotherapy. Late side effects of these treatment strategies have been under investigation for a long time [ 3 ]. Subsequently, oncologists have radically modified the treatment plans in most patients. Active surveillance after surgery without any systemic therapy or radiotherapy is becoming more popular in early-stage low-risk disease. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy still remains the mainstay of treatment in advanced and recurrent disease as novel treatments have not proven their efficacy yet [ 4 ]. The excellent cure rates in TC come at a price of late side effects in survivors [ 3 ,  5 ]. These side effects include a wide range of complications causing significant morbidity and early mortality in TCS. On one hand, these conditions cause early and premature mortality [ 6 ,  7 ], while on the other hand, they cause significant distress and detrimental effects on physical, social, sexual, economic, and psychological health [ 8 – 10 ]. Most commonly reported late side effects include second malignant neoplasms, late recurrence of TC, metachronous TC, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, hypogonadism, metabolic syndrome, renal insufficiency, neurotoxicity, ototoxicity and Raynaud’s phenomenon [ 5 – 8 ]. Psychosocial sequelae include anxiety, fear of cancer recurrence, risk of suicide, infertility, unemployment and financial toxicity [ 11 – 13 ]. In this study, we focus on the comorbidities in TCS after 5 years of diagnosis, causing mortality and morbidity in this group. This study is the first attempt to understand the TCS cohort in Ireland. Ireland has one of the highest incidences of TC worldwide [ 14 ] with treatment strategies similar to other European countries and the US. We conducted our research in one of the main tertiary care hospitals treating TC. The purpose of this study was to assess the point prevalence of late sequelae in TCS and also to provide a model of care. We believe this is the first study of its kind which provides comprehensive data based on clinical assessment of patients and also helps to establish care pathways for TCS. This article is the expanded version of the abstract published in the American Society of Clinical Oncology Journal as part of the annual meeting in June 2024 abstracts [ 15 ]."

        "content": "We identified all patients who had received treatment at Tallaght University Hospital in Dublin, which is one of the tertiary care cancer hospitals in Ireland for testicular cancer. Our records encompassed patients who had received treatment since 2006, which is the time when our department started maintaining a database for testicular cancer patients. Patients who had low-risk stage I disease followed up with the Urology Department instead of Medical Oncology, and hence were not included in our database. A research clinic was set up to perform an assessment on these patients. All patients who had crossed the 5-year (60-months) mark since diagnosis were invited to become part of the study. Only participants of age 18 and above at diagnosis were included in the study. In addition, the patients who had died after 5 years of diagnosis were also included in the study. Data was collected from February 2023 to February 2024. No exclusions were made based on treatment modalities; we included all patients, including those who underwent orchiectomy only. The study was granted approval in full by JREC (Joint Research and Ethics Committee) of Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin, Republic of Ireland. A written informed consent was obtained from the participants according to the ethics guidelines. Mortality data was collected through retrospective chart review. All staff involved in the study were trained in ethics, data protection, and Good Clinical Practice. Data was pseudo-anonymised at the time of collection. Complete anonymity was maintained during data processing and analysis. A comprehensive assessment was performed in our clinic, including symptoms review, systemic inquiry, clinical examination and blood tests. A retrospective review of medical charts, radiology and pathology reports was done to establish the initial diagnosis of germ cell tumours, treatments received and previously known co-morbidities. All second malignant neoplasms (SMNs), late recurrences of TCs and metachronous TCs reported in our study were diagnosed on the basis of pathology and radiology. Diagnosis of cardiovascular complications and hypertension was made after further investigations and assessment by the cardiology team. Low testosterone, high FSH (follicle stimulating hormone)/LH (luteinizing hormone), abnormal high glucose, lipids and impaired renal function were based on blood tests performed in the clinic. Hearing impairment was confirmed with audiograms in all cases. HADS (hospital anxiety and depression scale) scores were also included in routine assessments to determine the levels of anxiety and depression in our cohort. Medical conditions known to the patients before diagnosis of cancer were excluded. All comorbidities which developed since cancer diagnosis were divided into known or newly diagnosed during the assessment in our clinic. We analysed these comorbidities as a percentage of total patients to provide point prevalence in our cohort. Comorbidities were analysed and reported in the groups stratified on the basis of treatment modality for TC, pathology of TC (seminoma vs non-seminomatous germ cell tumours) and age at diagnosis (below 30 years Vs above 30 years), according to relevance."

        "content": "We identified 135 patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria of our study. We attempted to contact all of them, but only 110 patients responded. For some patients, the contact information was outdated, and others did not respond. A total of 93 patients agreed to be assessed in our clinic after a telephone conversation regarding our clinic, while 17 of them refused to attend. Out of those, 81 patients consented to be part of the study (Fig.  1 ), while the remaining patients declined to allow us to use their data for research purposes. Fig. 1 Number of patients inducted in the study Number of patients inducted in the study The age at the time of assessment ranged from 21 to 72 years, with a median of 43 years, and the age at initial diagnosis ranged from 16 to 61 years, with a median of 33 years. The median duration from diagnosis to assessment was 129 months (10.7 years), with a range of 60 to 304 months. All of the participants had germ cell tumours, more than half of them (57%) classified as non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT) and the rest (43%) as seminomas (Table  1 ).\n Table 1 Demographics of patient cohort Demographics of participants Age distribution Median age at diagnosis(range) Median time since diagnosis (range) 33 (16–61) years 129 (60–304) months Pathology NSGCT  n (%) Seminoma  n (%) 46 (57) 35 (43) Stage at diagnosis Stage I  n (%) Stage II  n (%) Stage III  n (%) 44 (54) 19 (23) 18 (22) Treatment Active Surveillance  n (%) Chemotherapy  n (%) Radiotherapy  n (%) RPLND  n (%) Orchiectomy  n (%) 26 (32) 69 (85) 4 (5) 14 (17) 80 (99) Chemotherapy regimen BEP1 BEP3 BEP4 EP4 VIP4 BEP3EP1 Carbo1 Other (HDCT, TICE) n  = 69 (%) 4 (6) 11 (16) 14 (20) 19 (28) 3 (4) 4 (6) 3 (4) 12 (17.4) Demographics of patient cohort Age distribution Median age at diagnosis(range) Median time since diagnosis (range) 33 (16–61) years 129 (60–304) months Pathology NSGCT  n (%) Seminoma  n (%) 46 (57) 35 (43) Stage at diagnosis Stage I  n (%) Stage II  n (%) Stage III  n (%) 44 (54) 19 (23) 18 (22) Treatment Active Surveillance  n (%) Chemotherapy  n (%) Radiotherapy  n (%) RPLND  n (%) Orchiectomy  n (%) 26 (32) 69 (85) 4 (5) 14 (17) 80 (99) Chemotherapy regimen BEP1 BEP3 BEP4 EP4 VIP4 BEP3EP1 Carbo1 Other (HDCT, TICE) n  = 69 (%) 4 (6) 11 (16) 14 (20) 19 (28) 3 (4) 4 (6) 3 (4) 12 (17.4) On initial presentation, 54% of patients were stage I, 23% stage II and 22% stage III cancer. Due to selection bias mentioned in study limitations, these findings are in contrast to the data maintained by National Cancer Registry of Ireland. According to the national database, 69% patients presented with stage I, 16% with stage II and only 10% with stage III [ 16 ]. Every patient underwent orchiectomy except for one, who presented with extra-testicular germ cell cancer. Active surveillance after orchiectomy was opted for in 26 (32%) patients, but unfortunately, 22 (85%) of them had a recurrence of disease after a median duration of 14 months. A significantly higher number (85%) of our study population had received chemotherapy due to unintentional selection bias explained in the limitations section below. Of those 69 patients who received chemotherapy, 11 received 3 cycles of BEP (bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin), 14 had 4 cycles of BEP, 19 had 4 cycles of EP (etoposide and cisplatin), and 4 had 4 cycles of VIP (etoposide, ifosfamide and cisplatin). In the adjuvant setting, 1 cycle of carboplatin was given to 3 patients, while 1 cycle of BEP was given to 4 patients. Details of treatments are mentioned in Table  1 . Radiotherapy was used in 4 (5%) patients, including one patient who received whole brain radiotherapy for brain mets. Retroperitoneal lymph node discussion (RPLND) for residual masses after chemotherapy was performed in 14 (17%) patients. No cases of primary RPLND in stage II disease were identified. We have summarised the prevalence of these sequelae in Fig.  2 . The details and discussion on these complications are reported in separate headings. Fig. 2 Prevalence (%) of late side effects in all TC survivors Prevalence (%) of late side effects in all TC survivors We identified five (6%) cases of SMNs, occurring at a median of 109 months (9 years) from diagnosis of TC. Chemotherapy had been used in all of these patients; none of them received any radiotherapy. Patients who developed SMNs were all aged 30 years or more at the time of TC diagnosis. All 3 deaths in our TC survivors were caused by SMNs. Malignancies included lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, oesophageal cancer and leiomyosarcoma. Our data showed one case of metachronous TC (1.2%). The patient was initially diagnosed with seminoma, treated with orchiectomy and radiotherapy, subsequently developed NSGCT after 7 years and underwent orchiectomy and chemotherapy. On follow-up after 14 years since the second TC, no signs of recurrence were found. Two (2.4%) cases of late recurrences of TC (after more than 5 years of diagnosis) were noted with a mean duration of 72 months (6 years) since the initial diagnosis. One of them had NSGCT treated with surgery and chemotherapy, while the other one had seminoma initially diagnosed at stage IB and treated with surgery only. NSGCT recurred as a teratoma, which was surgically resected, and seminoma was treated with chemotherapy. Both patients were disease-free at the time of follow-up which was more than 5 years since recurrence. In this study, four (5%) patients were found to have coronary artery disease. Half of them were already diagnosed, but the other half was only diagnosed during their assessment in the clinic. All of these patients (100%) had received chemotherapy and were aged more than 30 years at the time of TC diagnosis. No cases of cardiomyopathy were found in our study. Interestingly, 2 of these 4 patients were not aware of their underlying coronary artery disease. Systemic enquiry by our researchers led to further investigations by our cardiology team, which in turn diagnosed and managed their condition. This finding emphasises the need for screening clinics to reduce the mortality as a consequence of cardiovascular complications in TCS. Hypertension was found to be the second most common underlying condition in our study, with almost 40% of patients affected. The median duration to develop hypertension was 109 months (9 years), but only one-third of these patients were diagnosed in primary healthcare, and the rest were diagnosed in our clinic. Chemotherapy was used in 81% of the cases, and 75% were aged more than 30 years at the time of diagnosis. Our assessment revealed abnormally high glucose levels in seven (22%) patients, based on fasting glucose and HbA1c readings. Of those seven patients, six had received chemotherapy for treatment of TC and five were aged more than 30 years at diagnosis (Figs.  3 ). Fig. 3 Prevalence of late side effects in the patients who received chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy Prevalence of late side effects in the patients who received chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on weight and height measurements in clinic. We found high BMI in 42 (52%) patients with the majority (81%) belonging to the chemotherapy group. The internationally recognised range of normal BMI was utilised for assessment using height and weight measured in the clinic [ 17 ]. More than half (51%) of our patients had abnormal high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides on blood tests. Only a small minority (13%) were aware of this underlying condition, as most of them were diagnosed on screening. Dyslipidaemia was clearly predominant in the patients who received chemotherapy, accounting for more than 85% of patients. It was also more common in TCS diagnosed at > 30 years of age. We assessed serum testosterone and FSH/LH levels in all of our patients. An abnormal low-serum testosterone was subsequently confirmed with early morning fasting levels. We found low levels of testosterone in 28 (34.5%) and an abnormal high FSH or LH in 38 (47%) patients. Patients who had received chemotherapy accounted for almost all cases of gonadal dysfunction, representing almost 90% of this cohort. Even with a high prevalence of symptoms, only 17% of patients were aware of their underlying condition. In this cohort, the prevalence of hearing impairment was 29%, almost exclusively in the patients who received chemotherapy (95% of cases). Like in all other comorbidities, the majority of cases (76%) were diagnosed during screening in our clinic. Similarly, tinnitus was reported by 15 (18.5%) patients, and all of them had received chemotherapy. Only one of our patients was diagnosed with transient ischaemic attacks after detailed investigations of symptoms. No strokes were detected or reported in our study. On the contrary, 23 (28%) patients reported residual peripheral neuropathy after a median follow-up of 8.5 years. This assessment is solely based on patient-reported questionnaires since we could not perform any further investigations like nerve conduction studies to confirm the diagnosis. In this study, we did not find any cases of pulmonary disease diagnosed after TC diagnosis or treatment. Even though 42 (52%) of our patients had received one or more cycles of bleomycin. We found six (7.4%) patients with persistent renal impairment after a median follow-up of more than 10 years. Of note, only one out of these six patients had an established diagnosis of renal compromise. The rest of the five patients were diagnosed during screening in our clinic and later confirmed by the nephrology team. Similar to ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity was only found in patients who received chemotherapy. At the median follow-up of 12 years, Raynaud’s phenomenon was reported by 12(15%) patients, all of whom received chemotherapy for treatment of TC. Both patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease in our clinic had Raynaud’s phenomenon as well, which underscores the close relationship between the two complications. Out of 78 patients we assessed in our clinic, 76 filled out HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score) pro forma. An internationally accepted scale was used to interpret HADS results [ 18 ]. We found 17% of patients with mild anxiety and an additional 14.5% with moderate and severe anxiety. Only 8% of patients reported mild depression, and one respondent reported moderate levels."

As shown in Fig.  4 , the majority of the late complications were diagnosed in the clinic during assessment. Further investigations under a specialist team such as cardiology and endocrinology were performed for abnormal findings during screening. Fig. 4 Conditions diagnosed during screening in clinic compared to known comorbidities Conditions diagnosed during screening in clinic compared to known comorbidities Kvammen et al. have featured the causes of inferior survival in TCS with their registry-based study [ 7 ]. SMNs followed by cardiovascular complications were identified as the most common cause of early death in TCS. In our study, we have established that most of the cardiac risk factors, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and hypogonadism, can be detected and corrected with regular assessment of TCS. In this way, early deaths due to cardiac complications can be prevented. Lubberts et al. also noticed that when cardiac risk factors were treated, no excess risk of cardiac complications was found [ 19 ]. In the same way, regular symptom checks and clinical examinations might be able to identify early signs of malignancy and reduce the mortality related to SMNs. We do believe that a more comprehensive strategy is needed for early detection of solid tumours. A good example is early screening for breast and prostate cancer in patients with BRCA mutations."

        "content": "Regarding second malignancies, our findings are similar to the other studies investigating the same in TC survivors. Kvammen et al., in a wide, registry-based analysis, also reported SMNs as the commonest cause of death in TCS after 5 years [ 7 ]. The 25-year cumulative incidence of solid SMNs in TCS was reported at 10% by Groot et al., which is much higher than our observation [ 20 ], but our cohort is relatively much younger, with a median duration of around 10 years since diagnosis. Similar types of malignancies have been reported by other investigators [ 20 ,  21 ], and a higher prevalence with the use of chemotherapy and a higher age at diagnosis is also widely reported in the literature [ 7 ]. Mrinakova et al. performed a retrospective study to investigate the incidence of second TC in 2124 patients between 1970 and 2020 [ 22 ]. Overall incidence was reported at 4.1% in all cases after a median duration of 6.7 years in seminoma and 9.2 years in NSGCT patients. Similar to SMNs, our observed number is lower (1.2%) compared to their findings. Firstly, as mentioned earlier, our cohort is still young, and this incidence could rise in coming years. Secondly, we observed a disproportionately high percentage of patients who had received chemotherapy due to the reasons mentioned in limitations below. Chemotherapy has been reported to reduce the incidence of second TC [ 22 ,  23 ]. Our patient with metachronous TC had initial cancer at the age of 31, contrary to Hellesnes et al.’s finding of higher incidence with age less than 30 [ 23 ]. Ondrusova et al. also reported a 2.6% relapse rate in their retrospective analysis [ 24 ]. Late relapses have been reported with both seminoma and NSGCT [ 25 ] with an interval of 6–7 years from initial diagnosis [ 24 ,  26 ]. Late recurrence of teratoma in the second patient after chemotherapy has also been widely reported in the literature [ 24 ,  26 ,  27 ]. Lubberts et al. assessed the incidence of cardiovascular disease in a multicentre cohort including 4748 TCS. They reported a 5.7% incidence at a median of 16 years of follow-up [ 19 ], very similar to our findings. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy and an older age have been repeatedly reported in studies as major risk factors [ 19 ,  28 ,  29 ]. As mentioned above, Lubberts et al. conducted a comprehensive study to evaluate cardiovascular risk factors in the TC population of the Netherlands [ 19 ]. They reported hypertension in 50% of 4787 TC survivors compared to 39.5% in our study. This difference can be explained by the contrast in median follow-up of both studies. The median follow-up in this Dutch study was 22 years compared to 10 years in our study. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been reported in other studies to increase the risk of developing hypertension [ 5 ,  30 ). A staggering 40% of TCS with abnormally high glucose levels were found in their study compared to 22% in our cohort [ 19 ]. Again, this discrepancy between the two studies could be due to a longer duration of follow-up (10 vs 22 years). Both studies followed similar methods of assessment and cut-offs for normal levels. Pre-diabetic levels of impaired glucose are more prevalent in this cohort compared to diabetes [ 8 ]. Due to study limitations, we are not able to report the proportion of diabetics in this cohort. Many studies have reported a higher incidence of obesity and pre-obese high BMI after chemotherapy in TCS [ 5 ,  8 ,  19 ]. Kerns et al. assessed 1214 TCS who had received chemotherapy, in a multi-institute study. The study revealed 71.5% of TCS with high BMI with a median of 4.2 years since diagnosis [ 8 ]. Our study showed similar results with a high prevalence mainly in the chemotherapy group. Although a similar percentage (77%) was reported in all TCS by Agrawal et al. based on a questionnaire-based study conducted in the US, the chemotherapy cohort still had a much higher incidence [ 5 ]. While evaluating CVD risk factors in TCS, Lubberts et al. showed 85% of patients with dyslipidaemia [ 19 ]. Similar to differences in other results, a higher incidence in their study could be due to an older cohort of TCS (10 years vs 22 years of follow-up duration). As reported in our results, only 15% of TCS in this Dutch study were aware of their condition. In both cohorts, around 85% of patients were not conscious of their underlying disease. Our study findings are comparable to the study on hypogonadism conducted in the UK by Huddart, et al. [ 31 ]. They evaluated hormone levels in 640 patients in the survivorship phase of TC. Low levels of testosterone were found in 34% of the patients in the chemotherapy and radiotherapy group compared to 11% in the surveillance group. High FSH in the surveillance and chemotherapy/radiotherapy groups was 42% and 70%, respectively. A similar trend was seen with raised LH (6% in surveillance group vs 11% in chemotherapy/radiotherapy group). We reported similar results in our cohort. Huddart also highlighted issues of infertility and sexual dysfunction along with these hormonal abnormalities; we have reported these previously in a questionnaire-based survey [ 32 ]. Numerous studies have investigated the ototoxicity related to cisplatin exposure during treatment of TC. The most commonly reported incidence is around 30–40% in TCS who received chemotherapy, similar to our results [ 5 ,  8 ,  33 ]. A rise in incidence with higher age at diagnosis was also reported in a US study [ 5 ]. We found 28% of patients with residual peripheral neuropathy, similar to 26.5% reported by Agrawal et al. for the US population of TCS [ 5 ]. The prevalence of Raynaud’s phenomenon (15%) was also close to their study which reported Raynaud’s in 18% of all TCS and 33% in the TCS with prior exposure to chemotherapy [ 5 ]. For pulmonary toxicity, the most notable study on this subject was performed by Haugnes et al., in Norway. Around 16–17% of long-term survivors were found to have compromised pulmonary function after chemotherapy treatment [ 34 ]. The results from our study (0%) are possibly a consequence of more cautious use of bleomycin in TC patients. In the majority of studies evaluating renal impairment in TCS, the incidence is reported around 3% [ 5 ,  8 ]. A much higher incidence (23%) of reduced glomerular filtration rate has been mentioned after 1 year of cisplatin-based treatment [ 35 ]. Our study found 7.4% of patients with renal impairment. The prevalence of anxiety in our study goes in line with the 20% prevalence of anxiety in TCS after 5 years reported by AB Smith et al. [ 36 ]. The systematic review by Smith et al. reported no increased risk of depression in TCS compared to the general population."

        "content": "To our knowledge, this is the first research to provide a comprehensive care plan and a snapshot of every late side effect in all TCS. Previous studies providing prevalence and incidence in all TCS were mainly based on registry analysis or questionnaire-based surveys [ 5 ,  7 ]. Other studies evaluating patients with clinical assessment either focused on a group of patients [ 8 ] or a group of diseases [ 19 ]. In this study, we also propose a working model to improve the morbidity and mortality in TCS through nurse-led, purpose-built clinics with referral pathways in place. During our study, we noticed a great amount of interest from the survivors and the patient communities. Although, at the time of conception, we intended to include all patients, including those who underwent surveillance only after surgery, but unfortunately, we noticed an unintentional selection bias in our study. We only had access to the database maintained by the Medical Oncology Department of our hospital. Patients who receive orchiectomy alone, for low-risk stage I disease, are usually followed up by our surgical colleagues in the Urology Department, while high-risk stage I disease is referred to Medical Oncology for surveillance. This translated into a higher rate of recurrence in stage I patients and a higher proportion of patients who had received chemotherapy. Also, patients who had received chemotherapy or were experiencing any late side effects were more likely to attend our clinic and participate in the study. This selection bias dramatically affected our study outcomes, exaggerating the prevalence of late side effects and rates of recurrence. A more accurate estimate could be possible with certain conditions like Raynaud’s phenomenon and peripheral neuropathy by using specialised investigations. Due to limitations in resources, we could not perform these investigations. Also due to similar constraints, we did not include morbidities known to patients before TC diagnosis, which could have been exacerbated by the treatment."

        "content": "The cure rates in TC have improved with multimodal treatment strategies, but the care for survivors remains a challenge. TCS are facing a spectrum of physical, psychological and social challenges after the cure of cancer. Serious deficiencies can be seen in the survivorship care as most cancer centres do not offer any follow-up at the end of surveillance. Our study provides the magnitude of difficulties and a practical solution. We are hoping that further studies will build up on this knowledge and improve the survivorship care as well as raise awareness among healthcare providers and survivors. Five decades ago, testicular cancer patients emerged as pioneers in solid organ cure; now, they can become the pioneers in survivorship care."

    "abstract": "Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) occurs mainly in female patients. In males the occurrence rate is low, which seems to be related to the low incidence of osteoporosis in men. Unfortunately, BRONJ tends to be ignored in general dental clinics in male patients with a history of osteoporosis treatment. BRONJ occurred in a male patient due to the clinician's lack of interest in the patient's history. In this case, the male patient was on bisphosphonate therapy because of a orchiectomy, and a dental treatment was performed without consideration of his medical history, resulting in BRONJ. We performed careful examinations and treatment with antibiotics and surgical operations. The postoperative healing was successful. In light of this particular case, we concluded that careful listening to the patient's history is very important.",

        "content": "In Korea, the number of cases of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) occurring in female patients as a result of dental treatment following medication for postmenopausal osteoporosis has been recently increasing 1 . The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) define BRONJ as medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in cases where antiresorptive or antiangiogenic agents have been administered, continuous bone exposure in the maxillofacial area for a period of more than eight weeks has been confirmed, and radiation therapy of the maxillofacial area has not been performed 2 . The AAOMS also describe treatment methods according to the classifications determined by the patient's symptoms 2 . Although BRONJ occurs more frequently in females, there are cases of BRONJ occurring in males as well. These are mainly related to a history of malignancy, multiple myeloma, and osteoporosis which occurs as a result of aging 3 ."

        "content": "A male patient in his late eighties visited our department from a local clinic for treatment of osteonecrotic lesions of the right posterior maxillary region. He had undergone a tooth extraction (the first right upper molar) at a local clinic three years ago. The sequestrum was exposed through the unhealed extraction wound with purulent discharge. The surrounding soft tissue showed erythematous and edematous gingiva.( Fig. 1 ) The patient's medical history revealed that he had a orchiectomy to remove diffuse large B cell lymphoma from his testicles followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy to his para-aortic lymph nodes and pelvic region six years prior. Two years after the cancer treatments, he was diagnosed with osteoporosis and took alendronate (Fosamax Tab. 70 mg; MSD Korea, Seoul, Korea) once a week until visiting our department. At the time of osteoporosis diagnosis, his bone mineral density T-score was -2.7. Upon a radiologic study, we found sequestrum formation in the #16 area, which had a well-defined margin, making it easily distinguishable 4 . The region extended beyond the alveolar bone into the right maxillary sinus ( Fig. 2 ), and a bone scan image showed increased intake in the right maxillary area.( Fig. 3 ) Because there was an exposed bone lesion that extended to the right maxillary sinus, the patient was diagnosed with stage 3 BRONJ according to the AAOMS classification criteria 2 , and conservative treatment was primarily given. The laboratory tests showed carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) in serum 0.174 ng/mL, vitamin D 11.9 ng/mL (reference value, 30.1-100.0 ng/mL), and serum osteocalcin 1.4 ng/mL (reference value, 5-25 ng/mL). After an endocrinology consult, it was confirmed that surgical intervention would be possible and vitamin D (0.5 µg, once a day, Onealfa Tab.; Ilsung Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, Korea) was prescribed. After admission, intravenous antibiotics (four times a day, Fullgram Injection 300 mg; Samjin Pharm, Seoul, Korea) were given. We performed a surgical operation including sequestrum resection, partial maxillectomy, and extraction of the first and second premolars. The defect area was covered with a buccal fat pad flap.( Fig. 4 ) In order to relieve sinus symptoms, mucolytics and nasal decongestants were administered for two weeks following surgery. Biopsy results confirmed actinomycotic osteomyelitis 4 .( Fig. 5 ) Postoperative healing was uneventful. After discharge, regular follow-up visits were conducted. There were no signs of recurrence and a clean and fully healed mucosa was observed in the intraoral picture taken sixty days postoperatively.( Fig. 6 ) The postoperative X-ray showed a clearly resected bone margin and an uneventfully healed maxilla.( Fig. 7 )"

        "content": "Underlying diseases related to BRONJ include primarily malignant tumors, multiple myeloma and osteoporosis 3 . In this case, the patient's past medical history was significant for malignancy and osteoporosis, although osteoporosis was the primary indication for bisphosphonate treatment. BRONJ is more common in females because menopause is the main etiology of osteoporosis. The male-to-female incidence ratio of BRONJ is about 4:6, regardless of the underlying diseases 5 6 . In our research from 2007 to 2014, there were 11 male and 213 female BRONJ patients. In accordance with this, a medical history including osteoporosis is likely to be overlooked more frequently in male patients before dental treatment. In this case, osteoporosis developed as a result of aging and hypogonadism after receiving an orchiectomy and the patient was treated with alendronate (Fosamax Tab. 70 mg) for about four years. In this condition, bone turnover activity is suppressed and the tooth extraction was performed indiscriminately. We conclude that BRONJ might have developed through this serial pathway. Osteoporosis in males can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as old age, steroid abuse, alcoholism and hypogonadism 7 . Among these, hypogonadism is a commonly occurring consequence associated with orchiectomy 7 . Because complications such as pelvic fracture may frequently occur with hypogonadism, bisphosphonate therapy is necessary for this group of patients. When a dentist first meets these patients, a careful medical history is required as there is a risk of BRONJ. Osteoporosis in males tends to be overlooked or underestimated compared with females. Only 10% of male patients receive treatment for osteoporosis due to lack of awareness 8 , and the incidence of osteoporosis tends to increase more significantly in males over 70 years of age compared with females 7 . Cases of BRONJ affecting the maxilla are rarer than those in the mandible 9 . However, in the case of advanced maxillary lesions, sinusitis or intracranial complications can occur 10 11 . As most of these patients are elderly and many have a history of variable diseases, they require prompt treatment. In many BRONJ cases, infections and recurrence may occur; in other words, the healing process is often compromised for many reasons. Because of impaired vascularity, the healing alveolus may be vulnerable to bacterial infections. In order to reduce exposure to bacterial infections, primary closure is important 12 . We performed a sequestrectomy and partial maxillectomy, and primary closure with a buccal fat pad flap. The buccal fat pad flap is useful to cover soft tissue defects in the posterior maxillary regions, as well as other open wounds of the oral and maxillofacial regions, because it has high vascularity and adipose tissue stem cells which accelerate the healing process of necrotic lesions 13 . In this case, after successful primary closure with local mucosa and the buccal fat pad flap, the wound healed uneventfully."

    "title": "Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF-15) Plasma Levels Increase during Bleomycin- and Cisplatin-Based Treatment of Testicular Cancer Patients and Relate to Endothelial Damage",
    "abstract": "Introduction Chemotherapy-related endothelial damage contributes to the early development of cardiovascular morbidity in testicular cancer patients. We aimed to identify relevant mechanisms of and search for candidate biomarkers for this endothelial damage. Methods Human micro-vascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were exposed to bleomycin or cisplatin with untreated samples as control. 18k cDNA microarrays were used. Gene expression differences were analysed at single gene level and in gene sets clustered in biological pathways and validated by qRT-PCR. Protein levels of a candidate biomarker were measured in testicular cancer patient plasma before, during and after bleomycin-etoposide-cisplatin chemotherapy, and related to endothelial damage biomarkers (von Willebrand Factor (vWF), high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP)). Results Microarray data identified several genes with highly differential expression; e.g. Growth Differentiation Factor 15 ( GDF-15 ), Activating Transcription Factor 3 ( ATF3 ) and Amphiregulin ( AREG ). Pathway analysis revealed strong associations with ‘p53’ and ‘Diabetes Mellitus’ gene sets. Based on known function, we measured GDF-15 protein levels in 41 testicular patients during clinical follow-up. Pre-chemotherapy GDF-15 levels equalled controls. Throughout chemotherapy GDF-15, vWF and hsCRP levels increased, and were correlated at different time-points. Conclusion An unbiased approach in a preclinical model revealed genes related to chemotherapy-induced endothelial damage, like  GDF-15 . The increases in plasma GDF-15 levels in testicular cancer patients during chemotherapy and its association with vWF and hsCRP suggest that GDF-15 is a potentially useful biomarker related to endothelial damage.",

        "content": "The introduction of platinum-based chemotherapy in the late seventies has resulted in high cure rates in patients with metastatic testicular cancer. However, this chemotherapy causes side-effects, resulting in morbidity in successfully treated survivors [ 1 ]. Relevant issues are the increased risks for second malignancies and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [ 2 – 5 ]. CVD can arise during or shortly after treatment [ 6 ,  7 ], as well as years to decades later [ 3 – 5 ,  8 – 11 ]. One of the mechanisms involved in the development of this treatment-related CVD is direct endothelial damage. In addition to induction of endothelial cell death [ 12 – 14 ], both bleomycine [ 14 – 16 ] and cisplatin [ 14 ,  17 – 19 ] indirectly influence endothelial cell function, e.g. through interference with inflammatory and fibrinolytic factors. Ultimately, this chemotherapy-induced cellular activation can progress to endothelial dysfunction, accelerated atherosclerosis and overt CVD. Early recognition and possibly prevention of these treatment-related complications are critical to maintain an optimal health condition of testicular cancer survivors. The development of CVD is a gradual process, and early interventions or intensified screening may slow down or stop the progression towards overt clinical morbidity. Biomarkers for treatment-related endothelial damage can identify those patients at increased risk for CVD. In this study we back-translated the clinical finding that bleomycin and cisplatin induce endothelial damage. We used an unbiased approach by analysing cDNA microarray results to identify novel genes associated with chemotherapy-related endothelial damage. Gene expression profiles were generated from the human microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1) before and after treatment with bleomycin and cisplatin at different time points and concentrations. Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to confirm genes with significant expression differences in several experimental settings. Next, based on known function of these genes in the literature, we selected one of these candidate genes for further validation as proof of principle at the protein level in a testicular cancer patient cohort. With this translational approach we aimed to identify mechanisms of and potential biomarkers for chemotherapy-related endothelial damage."

        "content": "HMEC-1 is an immortalised human dermal micro-vascular endothelial cell line that retains its morphologic and functional endothelial cell characteristics during several passages [ 20 ]. Cells were grown as a monolayer in MCDB-131 medium (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Bodinco, Alkmaar, the Netherlands), 10 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium), 1 μg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and 10 ng/mL human epidermal growth factor (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), and were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . Experiments were performed between passages 15–30. In an “acute”-exposure setting, HMEC-1 were left untreated as controls, or were treated with 0.3 (IC 50  (concentration inhibiting cell survival by 50%)) or 1.5 μg/mL (IC 90 ) bleomycin and 2.6 (IC 50 ) or 12.9 μM (IC 90 ) cisplatin for 6, 24, and 48 hours ( S1A Fig. ). The IC50 values for both bleomycin and cisplatin fall within the plasma physiological concentrations of these drugs in patients during active treatment [ 14 ,  21 – 22 ]. In addition, in a “chronic”-exposure setting, lower doses were administered (IC 10 ; bleomycin 0.06 μg/mL or cisplatin 0.52 μM) two times a week; cells were collected for analysis at day 30 ( S1B Fig. ). Administration of cisplatin had to be withheld at the 7 th  administration because of considerable cell death, but was continued at full dose thereafter. Bleomycin could be administered without interruption. Total RNA was isolated from HMEC-1 by a RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) and pooled for each time-point and drug from 2 independent experiments. After purification (Qiaquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands), amplified RNA (cRNA) samples were transformed to cDNA with reverse transcriptase, independently labelled with Cy3 (green) and Cy5 (red), and randomly hybridised to the custom-made 18K cDNA microarrays. Fluorescent images of the microarray slides were obtained with the Affymetrix GMS428 scanner (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) for both fluorophores, signal intensities for each spot were quantified by dedicated IMAGENE 5.6 software (Biodiscovery, Marina del Rey, CA). Quantile normalisation was applied to log2 transformed Cy3 and Cy5 intensities. Operon v2.0 (Human Genome Oligo Set V2) probe identifiers were converted to official HUGO gene symbols. Expression values of multiple probes targeting a single gene were averaged, resulting in a total of 15,950 unique genes. Subsequently, expression data obtained from multiple hybridisations ( n  = 4) of the same HMEC-1 specimen were averaged. The data have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and are accessible through GEO Series Accession number  GSE62523  ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62523 ). In the “acute” exposure setting, differentially expressed genes between HMEC-1 untreated samples and samples exposed to the different drug dosages (i.e. IC 50  and IC 90 ) were tested with the non-parametric Cuzick test for linear trend, resulting in a  Z  score and a  P  value. This test was done for cells collected after 6 ( t  = 6), 24 ( t  = 24) and 48 ( t  = 48) hours. For all three time-points the  Z  score resulting from the Cuzick tests for linear trend was summed (i.e.  ΣZ  =  Z t = 6  +  Z t = 24  +  Z t = 48 ); thereby selecting on genes with the constraint that changes in expression in a consistent direction with increasing concentrations over time. Genes were ranked according to their  ΣZ  score. In the “chronic” exposure setting, a T-test was performed on gene expression levels obtained from samples exposed to the drugs (IC 10  cisplatin or IC 10  bleomycin) versus the untreated control samples that were collected after 30 days incubation. Results of these genes were ranked according to  P- value. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [ 23 ] was executed with GSEA 2.0 software package (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Expression data of all 15,950 genes were compared against functional gene sets to determine whether any of these sets were enriched in HMEC-1 treated with bleomycin or cisplatin in the “acute” as well as the “chronic” exposure setting. The comparison was performed using 169 gene sets from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG;  http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ). Statistical significance of enrichment was determined using an empirical gene-based permutation test using 1000 permutations. A false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated for each functional gene set, which represent the estimated probability that a given enrichment score represents a false positive finding. We report gene sets with a FDR ≤ 0.10 and  P  ≤ 0.025. Differential expression of three genes was validated by qRT-PCR. For this purpose, RNA samples included in the cDNA microarray analysis were used. In addition, two independent experiments were performed in which HMEC-1 was exposed to cisplatin and bleomycin according to the “acute”-exposure setting. RNA samples were isolated after 6, 24 and 48 hours exposure to the drugs ( S1A Fig. ). All RNA samples were DNase treated to eliminate genomic DNA-contamination, and subsequently, RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA. qRT-PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems TaqMan assays, according to the manufacturers protocol. Master Mix, primers and TaqMan probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel, the Netherlands). Three genes, with highly differential expression in three out of four experimental settings, were considered plausible candidates for qRT-PCR validation. The genes and their respective Taqman gene expression assay numbers were Growth Differentiation Factor 15 ( GDF-15;  Hs00171132_m1), Activating Transcription Factor 3 ( ATF3;  Hs00231069_m1), Amphiregulin ( AREG;  Hs00155832_m1); in addition expression of the housekeeping gene Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ; Hs02758991_g1) was determined. All experiments were performed in triplicate using ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System, with the following cycling conditions: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Relative quantity of target genes was calculated by dividing the mean cycle threshold (CT) for the gene of interest by the mean CT-value for the housekeeping gene  GAPDH . Relative expression-differences were calculated by comparing expression to the baseline time-point (t = 6,  S1A Fig. ). Two-sided t-test was used to compare differences in expression. P-values < 0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference. To clinically validate the findings from the cell line model, we used a cohort of 41 testicular cancer patients who participated in a prospective study on early chemotherapy-related cardiovascular changes during bleomycin- and cisplatin-based regimens. Patients eligible for the study had metastatic testicular cancer, were 18–50 years old and were receiving first line cisplatin-based chemotherapy at the University Medical Centre Groningen, the Netherlands. Exclusion criteria were previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, presence of CVD, use of erythropoietin and glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min. The local ethics committee approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Depending on their International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) prognosis group, patients received either three or four BEP courses lasting 3 weeks each (bleomycin—30 USP, days 2, 8 and 15; etoposide—100 mg/m 2 , days 1–5) and cisplatin—20 mg/m 2 , days 1–5). During the first 6 days patients were hydrated with 4 L NaCl 0.9%/day and received daily anti-emetic therapy (dexamethason, ondansetron). Blood samples were drawn at day 1, 8 and 15 of the first chemotherapy course, day 1 and 8 of the second and third course, (c1d1 (= baseline), c1d8, c1d15, c2d1, etc.), one month after completion and one year after start of chemotherapy. EDTA plasma was serially collected and stored in -20°C until analysis. Reference data were obtained from healthy male siblings of adult childhood cancer survivors, who had participated as control subjects in a cross-sectional study on late cardiovascular sequelae of treatment for childhood cancer [ 24 ]. Out of these healthy male siblings, a control group with a comparable median age as the testicular cancer patients was selected. Measurements in the controls were performed as described above. Plasma GDF-15 protein levels were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a commercially available kit (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Furthermore, these GDF-15 protein levels were related to plasma markers for endothelial damage (von Willebrand Factor (vWF), measured as described earlier) [ 25 ] and systemic inflammation (high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), as described earlier) [ 26 ]. For analysis of changes in these markers, non-normally distributed data are represented as median (range). For comparisons between groups the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was applied; the Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was used for paired changes. Two-sided P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered to indicate significance, SPSS software package version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used."

In the “acute”-exposure setting to bleomycin, six pathways were enriched (all up-regulated), while no pathways were enriched in the “chronic” setting with the set criteria for FDR. Cisplatin exposure resulted in 12 enriched pathways in the “acute”-exposure setting (up-regulated n = 3, down-regulated n = 9) while six pathways were enriched in the “chronic”-exposure setting (all down-regulated). The ‘p53’ and the ‘Type I Diabetes Mellitus’ gene sets were enriched in three out of four exposure settings; genes included in this gene set are summarised in  S1 Table . No pathways were enriched according to these criteria after “chronic” exposure to bleomycin. To validate changes in expression of  GDF-15 ,  ATF3  and  AREG  qRT-PCR was performed. In the “acute”-exposure setting, mRNA-expression of all three genes increased in time after exposure to bleomycin and cisplatin, in concordance with the microarray data. After 48 hours exposure to both drugs, mRNA expression of all three genes was significantly higher compared to untreated control cells. No change in mRNA expression of these three genes occurred in untreated control cells in time ( Fig. 2 ). Based on data from the literature we selected GDF-15 for further validation on the protein level in plasma of testicular cancer patient during and after treatment, and related GDF-15 levels to known plasma endothelial damage biomarkers (vWF, hsCRP) [ 25 ,  26 ]. Baseline characteristics of the patients are summarised in  Table 3 . Although short from significance (p = 0.06), baseline (i.e. before start of chemotherapy) GDF-15 protein levels in testicular cancer patients were not different from healthy age-matched males ( Fig. 3A ). Patients in the IGCCCG good prognosis group had slightly lower baseline GDF-15 protein levels than patients in intermediate or poor prognosis groups (good prognosis: median 362.9 pg/mL (range 197.6–1059.5; n = 33), intermediate/poor prognosis: median 689.1 pg/mL (range 186.8–1935.0; n = 8);  P  = 0.04). Median baseline GDF-15 level was not related to tumor stage (stage 2 disease: median 373.0 pg/mL (range 197.6–1935.0; n = 30), stage 3&4 disease: median 486.4 pg/mL (range 186.8–1875.9; n = 11);  P  = 0.40).

During BEP-chemotherapy, GDF-15 protein levels increased compared to baseline, with significantly higher levels 1 months and 1 year post-chemotherapy ( Fig. 3B ,  Table 4 ). Compared to pre-chemotherapy, plasma levels of vWF and hsCRP changed significantly during treatment ( Table 4 ). After completion of chemotherapy, vWF-levels remained persistently elevated, whereas hsCRP returned to pre-chemotherapy values. At baseline, levels of GDF-15 were related to levels of vWF (r s  = 0.35;  P  = 0.03) and hsCRP (r s  = 0.39;  P  = 0.014).

        "content": "In this study we used an unbiased translational approach with cDNA microarray as a tool to find novel mechanisms related to and select candidate biomarkers involved in chemotherapy-induced endothelial damage. With this  in vitro  strategy, we found several single genes with significant changes in expression upon exposure to bleomycin and cisplatin. Three genes with strong expression differences in three out of four experimental settings,  GDF-15 ,  ATF3  and  AREG , were validated by qRT-PCR. In addition, GSEA revealed clusters of genes involved in several pathways, including ‘p53’ and ‘Type I Diabetes Mellitus’ gene sets, which were affected in this model. Furthermore, we showed that BEP-chemotherapy (Bleomycin; Etoposide; Cisplatin) did indeed affect plasma GDF-15 protein levels in testicular cancer patients and that these levels related to known endothelial damage biomarkers such as vWF and hsCRP. In the single gene analysis several genes were significantly differentially expressed in the different experimental settings in the HMEC-1  in vitro  model. The genes  GDF-15 ,  ATF3  and  AREG  were in the top 50’s of most differentially expressed genes in three or four exposure settings. The cytokine GDF-15 (also known as Macrophage Inhibitory Cytokine 1 (MIC-1) or NSAID activated gene (NAG-1)) is a member of the Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) family. GDF15 is induced by all sorts of stimuli including cytokines, chemo- and/or radiotherapy and injury in all sorts of different cells and tissues [ 27 – 30 ]. Release of GDF-15 can induce anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects, thereby exerting vasculoprotective mechanisms. Therefore, increases in GDF-15 plasma levels in our patient cohort may well result from increased production by endothelial cells and/or macrophages, to compensate for chemotherapy-induced damage. In a study evaluating gene expression changes in prostate cancer samples pre- and post docetaxel/mitoxantrone treatment,  GDF-15  was one of highest up-regulated genes post-treatment [ 31 ], illustrating that cytostatics can influence  GDF-15  expression in both malignant and non-malignant cells. Elevated levels of GDF-15 have been associated with increased risk of diseases hypothesised to result from chronic inflammation [ 29 ,  32 ] and numerous studies showed that GDF-15 is a valuable biomarker for cardiovascular disease [ 29 ,  30 ,  32 – 34 ]. GDF-15 is thought to play a relevant role in cardiovascular damage responses [ 35 ], possibly through a pro-angiogenic response as was demonstrated in a pre-clinical model with HUVEC [ 36 ]. GDF-15 is also described as biomarker/predictor of albuminuria, known to reflect established micro-vascular damage [ 37 ]. In addition, several studies implicate GDF-15 in aspects of metabolic disorders e.g. insulin resistance and obesity [ 30 ,  38 ,  39 ]. Recently, higher levels of circulating MIC-1/GDF-15 were also associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer supporting a role of chronic inflammation in the development of colorectal cancer [ 40 ]. ATF3  is a downstream member of the MAP-kinase signalling pathway that encodes for a nuclear factor that stimulates transcription upon cellular stress. Fast up-regulation of  ATF3  is a central stress response in different endothelial cell models, induced by various noxious stimuli [ 41 – 46 ]. Interference with  ATF3 -levels protected cells from apoptosis induction, e.g. induced by TNFα in HUVEC [ 47 ], by cisplatin in a human glioblastoma cell line [ 42 ], or related to doxorubicin in cardiomyocytes [ 48 ]. Interestingly, immunohistochemically measured  ATF3 -expression is increased in atherosclerotic areas of human iliac arteries [ 43 ]. Few studies addressed  AREG , a member of the epidermal growth factor receptors that plays an important role in cellular proliferation and survival. Breast cancer cells exposed to cisplatin secreted the AREG-protein over extended periods of time, i.e. up to 72 hours after exposition [ 49 ]. Based on the available data we decided to study plasma protein levels of GDF-15 in testicular cancer patients before, during and after treatment with BEP-chemotherapy, and relate changes to levels of known endothelial damage biomarkers [ 25 ,  26 ]. The increases in GDF-15 throughout treatment as well as post-chemotherapy may partly relate to cancer-related mechanisms, as the GDF-15 protein level wasslightly higher in patients with more advanced disease stage as measured by IGCCCG score, which may relate to release of GDF-15 from apoptotic tumour cells. However, its role in endothelial damage is supported by the fact that GDF-15 levels correlated with proteins known to reflect chemotherapy-related endothelial damage in testicular cancer patients, vWF and hsCRP [ 25 ,  26 ]. Therefore, it is conceivable that the observed rise in plasma GDF15 is involved in chemotherapy-related endothelial damage, however it is probably not due to endothelial injury alone. As this protein is mechanistically related to chemotherapy-related endothelial damage it may be a potentially sensitive biomarker for detecting this damage. Further extended analysis of GDF15 levels in combination with phenotyping of cardiovascular risk factors in a larger cohort of patients is warranted. Although in this study no relation was found between pretreatment levels of GDF15 and age, it is known that this is the case in the normal population and should be taken into account when analyzing GDF15 levels in time. Moreover, the fact that the TGFβ-pathway is involved in this damage may be a clue to interventions that decrease the amount of endothelial damage related to treatment with bleomycin and cisplatin. GSEA showed significantly enriched of several pathways, including ‘p53’ and ‘Type I Diabetes Mellitus’ in “acute” exposure to bleomycin and cisplatin, and “chronic” exposure to cisplatin. The finding that p53-related genes were affected by bleomycin as well as cisplatin illustrates the validity of our approach, as both drugs exert their key therapeutic effect by cellular apoptosis induction. The enriched ‘Type I Diabetes Mellitus’ gene set includes several genes involved in inflammatory processes, e.g. Human Leucocyte Antigen-molecules, interleukins and TNF, indicating that bleomycin and cisplatin induce an inflammatory response in endothelial cells. This finding is completely in line with studies in testicular cancer patients treated with cisplatin-based regimens, which showed higher rates of systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction [ 25 ,  26 ,  50 ]. As circulating platinum remains detectable in the circulation years to decades after cisplatin treatment [ 51 – 52 ], long-term testicular cancer survivors may well have ongoing vascular damage and chronic low-grade endothelial inflammation. When chronic inflammatory responses prove to be an important pathogenic factor for the development of chemotherapy-induced endothelial damage, intervention with anti-inflammatory drugs is a rationale approach to alleviate these effects. In conclusion, we utilised cDNA microarray to detect in an unbiased way genes and pathways associated with chemotherapy-related endothelial damage, to find biomarkers for and mechanisms involved in this damage. In HMEC-1 exposed to bleomycin and cisplatin, several genes were strongly differentially expressed, e.g.  GDF-15 ,  ATF3  and  AREG . In GSEA, clusters of genes involved in cell death and inflammation were affected. The observed changes in plasma GDF-15 protein levels in testicular cancer patients induced by cisplatin- and bleomycin-containing chemotherapy indicate that this informative pre-clinical approach can be translated to a clinical setting, and that GDF-15 may be a potential biomarker of interest that is mechanistically involved in chemotherapy-related healthy tissue damage such as endothelial damage. Further  in vitro  and  in vivo  exploration is warranted. This facilitates the rationale towards selection of targets for intervention, with early surrogate biomarkers for chemotherapy-related endothelial damage."
